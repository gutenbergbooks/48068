<p class="pc4 elarge">CURSED</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">AT BATU KAWAN</p>

<p>Slashed across the copper bowl of sunset, the jagged
silhouette of tawny-shouldered mountains, fringed with
areca-palms in black fretwork against the swift-fading
glow, divided the tropic sky. Above, day yet lingered.
Below, night’s dim shroud, here and there spangled
with glow-lights still or moving, had already folded
earth in its obscurity.</p>

<p>Down from that mountain crest the descending
slopes fell through grove and plantation to the drowned
paddy-fields and to the miasmatic swamps, brooded by
settling mists like thin, white breath of ghosts that in
this Malay land all men gave faith to.</p>

<p>Nearer still, it reached the squalid <i>campong</i> of Batu
Kawan. Batu Kawan, huddled in filth, disorder and
disease between the steaming arsenical green of the
lowlands and the muddy idleness of the boat-jammed
Timbago River. Batu Kawan, whence the New Bedford
clipper-ship, <i>Silver Fleece</i>, should have sailed two
hours ago on the high tide, this 18th day of February,
1868. Batu Kawan, pestilent, malodorous, sinister,
swarming with easy life, hemmed round with easier
death.</p>

<p>William Scurlock, mate, was looking townward,
leaning with crossed arms on rail. The umber smudge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of half-light in the sky, fading over the torn edge of
the mountains, revealed something of his blond bigness,
freckled, weather-bitten, with close-cropped hair,
a scarred jaw and hard teeth that gripped his cutty-pipe
in bulldog fashion.</p>

<p>Scurlock seemed to be engaged with inward visionings,
rather than outward. The occasional come-and-go
of some dim figure in the waist of the ship, the
fan-tan game of four or five Malay seamen&mdash;for the
<i>Silver Fleece</i> carried a checkerboard crew, white,
yellow and brown&mdash;as they squatted on their hunkers
under the vague blur of a lantern just forward of the
mainmast, and the hiccoughing stridor of an accordion
in the fo’c’s’le, roused in him no reaction.</p>

<p>Nor, as he lolled there under the awning, did he appear
to take heed of the mud-clogged river with its
jumble of sampans and house-boats, or of the thatched
huts and tiled <i>godowns</i> past which the colorful swarm
of Oriental life was idling along the bund. This stewing
caldron of heat, haze, odors, dusk where fruit-bats
staggered against the appearing stars said nothing
whatever to the mate. All he could see in it was inefficiency,
delay and loss.</p>

<p>Not all its wizardry of gleaming lights in hut and
shop, its firefly paper lanterns, its murmuring strangeness
could weigh against the vexing fact that his ship
had missed the tide, and that&mdash;though her full cargo
of tea, rattan, tapioca, cacao and opium was under
hatches&mdash;she still lay made fast to the bamboo mooring-piles.
What could offset the annoyance that Captain
Alpheus Briggs, ashore on business of his own,
was still delaying the vital business of working downstream
on the ebb?</p>

<p>“Devil of a cap’n!” grumbled Scurlock. He spat
moodily into the dark waters, and sucked at his pipe.
“Ain’t it enough for him to have put in a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
boxes of raw opium, which is liable to land us all in
hell, without stealin’ a nigger wench an’ now drinkin’
samshu, ashore? Trouble comin’&mdash;mutiny an’ murder
an’ damnation with trimmin’s, or I’m no Gloucester
man!”</p>

<p>Savagely he growled in his deep throat. Scurlock
disapproved of Batu Kawan and of all its works, especially
of its women and its raw rice-whisky. The East
grated on his taut nerves. Vague singing in huts and
the twangle of musically discordant strings set his
teeth on edge. He hated the smells of the place, all
seemingly compounded of curry and spices and mud
and smoke of wood fires, through which the perfumes
of strange fruits and heavy flowers drifted insistently.</p>

<p>The voices of mothers calling their naked little ones
within their doors, lest Mambang Kuning, the yellow
devil who dwells in the dusk, should snatch them,
jarred upon his evil temper. So, too, the monotonous
<i>tunk-tunk-tunk</i> of metal-workers’ hammers in
some unseen place; the snuffling grunt of carabaos
wallowing in the mud-swale beyond the guava clump,
up-stream; the nasal chatter of gharry-drivers and
Kling boatmen; the whining sing-song of Malay pedlers
with shouldered poles, whence swung baskets
of sugar-cane and mangosteens. Scurlock abominated
all that shuffling, chattering tangle of dark,
half-clad life. The gorge of his trim, efficient, New
England soul rose up against it, in hot scorn.</p>

<p>“Damn the Straits!” he grumbled, passing his hand
over his forehead, sweaty in the breathless heat.
“An’ damn Briggs, too! It’s my last voyage East,
by joycus!”</p>

<p>Which was, indeed, the living truth, though by no
means as Scurlock meant or understood it.</p>

<p>A plaintive hail from the rough brick coping of
the bund drew his atrabilious attention. The mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
saw that a brown, beardless fellow was making gestures
at him. A lantern on the quarterdeck flung
unsteady rays upon the Malay’s nakedness, complete
save for the breech-clout through which a kris was
thrust. In his left hand he gripped a loose-woven
coir bag, heavily full. His left held out, on open
palm, three or four shining globules. Scurlock
viewed with resentment the lean, grinning face, lips
reddened and teeth jet-black by reason of long years
of chewing lime and betel.</p>

<p>“Turtle egg, sar, sellum piecee cheap,” crooned the
Malay. “Buyum turtle egg, sar?”</p>

<p>Scurlock’s answer was to bend, reach for a piece
of holystone in a bucket by the rail, and catapult it
at the vagabond who had made so bold as to interrupt
his musings. The Malay swung aside; the holystone
crunched into the sack of eggs and slid to earth.</p>

<p>The screaming curse of the barbarian hardly crossed
the rail ahead of the flung kris. The wavy, poisoned
blade flickered, spinning. Scurlock stooped
away; the fraction of an eyewink later would have
done his life’s business very neatly. Into the mizzen-mast
drove the kris, and quivered there.</p>

<p>Scurlock turned, strode to it and plucked it out,
swearing in his rage. The Malays at fan-tan by the
gleam of the slush-light under the awning grew
silent. Their fantastic little cards, of gaudy hue,
dropped unheeded; for they had heard the name of
Ratna Mutnu Manikam, god who brings death.
Wherefore they shuddered, and turned scared faces
aft; and some touched heart and forehead, warding
off the curse.</p>

<p>Back to the rail, kris in hand, ran Scurlock.</p>

<p>“<i>Juldi</i>, you!” he shouted, with an oath unprintable.
“Top your broom, you black swine&mdash;skip, before I
come ashore an’ split you! <i>Juldi jao!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The Malay hesitated. Scurlock, flinging “<i>Sur!</i>”
at him, which in the <i>lingua franca</i> denominates a
swine, started for the gangway. Silently the Malay
faded into the little fringe of brown and yellow folk
that had already gathered; and so he vanished. Scurlock
was already setting foot upon the gangway that
led slantwise down to the bund, when through the
quickly coagulating street-crowd an eddy, developing,
made visible by the vague light a large head covered
with a topi hat wrapped in a pugree. Powerful
shoulders and huge elbows, by no means chary of
smashing right and left against the naked ribs, cleared
a passage, amid grunts and gasps of pain; and once
or twice the big man’s fists swung effectively, by way
of make-weight.</p>

<p>Then to William Scurlock’s sight appeared a tall,
heavy-set figure, rather dandified, in raw yellow bamboo
silk and with very neatly polished boots that
seemed to scorn the mud of Batu Kawan. A first
glance recorded black brows of great luxuriance, a
jungle of black beard contrasting sharply with a face
reddened by wind, weather and hard liquor, and, in
the V of a half-opened shirt, a corded neck and hairy
chest molded on lines of the young Hercules. This
man would be going on for twenty-eight or so. Fists,
eyes and jaw all lusted battle.</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs, captain and part owner of the <i>Silver
Fleece</i>, had returned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">ALPHEUS BRIGGS, BUCKO</p>

<p>For a moment, Briggs and Scurlock confronted
each other, separated by the length of the gangway.
Between them stretched silence; though on the bund
a cackle and chatter of natives offended the night.
Then Captain Briggs got sight of the kris. That sufficed,
just as anything would have sufficed. He put
his two huge, hairy fists on his hips; his neck swelled
with rage born of samshu and a temper by nature the
devil’s own; he bellowed in a formidable roar:</p>

<p>“Drop that knife, Mr. Scurlock! What’s the matter
with you, sir?”</p>

<p>A wise mate would have obeyed, with never one
word of answer. But Mr. Scurlock was very angry,
and what very angry man was ever wise? He stammered,
in a burst of rage:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;a Malay son of a pup&mdash;he hove it at me, an’
I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hove it at you, did he, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tigerish with drunken ferocity, Briggs sprang up
the plank. A single, right-hand drive to the jaw
felled Scurlock. The kris jangled away and came
to rest as Scurlock sprawled along the planking.</p>

<p>“<i>Sir</i>, Mr. Scurlock!” fulminated Briggs&mdash;though
not even in this blind passion did he forget sea-etiquette,
the true-bred Yankee captain’s “touch of the
aft” in dealing with an officer. No verbal abuse;
just the swinging fists now ready to knock Scurlock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
flat again, should he attempt to rise. “Say <i>sir</i> to me,
Mr. Scurlock, or I’ll teach you how!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” mumbled the mate, half dazed. He struggled
to a sitting posture, blinking up with eyes of
hate at the taut-muscled young giant who towered
over him, eager for another blow.</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Scurlock, and don’t forget I got
a handle to my name, next time you speak to me. If
any man, fore or aft, wants any o’ my fist, let him
leave off <i>sir</i>, to me!”</p>

<p>He kicked Scurlock heavily in the ribs, so that the
breath went grunting from him; then reached down
a gorilla-paw, dragged him up by the collar and
flung him staggering into the arms of “Chips,” the
clipper’s carpenter&mdash;Gascar, his name was&mdash;who had
just come up the quarterdeck companion. Other
faces appeared: Bevans, the steward, and Prass, the
bo’sun. Furiously Briggs confronted them all.</p>

<p>“Understand me?” he shouted, swaying a little as
he stood there with eager fists. “Where’s Mr. Wansley?”</p>

<p>“Asleep, sir,” answered Bevans. Wansley, second-mate,
was indeed dead to the world in his berth.
Most of the work of stowing cargo had fallen on him,
for in the old clippers a second-mate’s life hardly outranked
a dog’s.</p>

<p>“What right has Mr. Wansley to be sleeping?”
vociferated the captain, lashing himself into hotter
rage. “By God, you’re all a lot of lazy, loafing, impudent
swine!”</p>

<p>One smash of the fist and Bevans went staggering
toward the forward companion ladder, near the foot
of which a little knot of seamen, white, brown and
yellow, had gathered in cheerful expectation of seeing
murder done.</p>

<p>Briggs balanced himself, a strange figure in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dandified silk and polished boots, with his topi hat
awry, head thrust forward, brows scowling, massive
neck swollen with rage and drink. Under the smudgy
gleam of the lantern on the mizzen, his crimson face,
muffled in jetty beard, and the evil-glowering eyes of
him made a picture of wrath.</p>

<p>Briggs stooped, snatched up the kris that lay close
by his feet, and with a hard-muscled arm whistled
its keen edge through air.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep order on my ship,” he blared, passionately,
“and if I can’t do it with my fists, by God,
I’ll do it with this! The first man that loosens his
tongue, I’ll split him like a herring!”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs, just a moment, sir!” exclaimed
a voice at his left. A short, well-knit figure in blue,
advancing out of the shadows, ’round the aft companion,
laid a hand on the drunken brute’s arm.</p>

<p>“You keep out of this, doctor!” cried Briggs.
“They’re a mutinous, black lot o’ dogs that need
lickin’, and I’m the man to give it to ’em!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, sir, of course,” Dr. Filhiol soothed the
beast. “But as the ship’s physician, let me advise you
to go to your cabin, sir. The heat and humidity are
extremely bad. There’s danger of apoplexy, sir, if
you let these fellows excite you. You aren’t going
to give them the satisfaction of seeing you drop dead,
are you, captain?”</p>

<p>Thrown off his course by this new idea, Briggs
peered, blinked, pushed back his topi and scratched
his thick, close-curling poll. Then all at once he nodded,
emphatically.</p>

<p>“Right you are, doctor!” he cried, his mood swiftly
changing. “I’ll go. They shan’t murder me&mdash;not
yet, much as they’d like to!”</p>

<p>“Well spoken, sir. You’re a man of sense, sir&mdash;rare
sense. And on a night like this&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“The devil’s own night!” spat Briggs. “God,
the breath sticks in my throat!” With thick, violent
fingers he ripped at his shirt, baring his breast.</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs!” exclaimed Scurlock, now on his
feet again. “Listen to a word, sir, please.”</p>

<p>“What the damnation now, sir?”</p>

<p>“We’ve lost the tide, sir. The comprador sent
word aboard at four bells, he couldn’t hold his sampan
men much longer. We should be standin’ downstream
now, sir.” Scurlock spoke with white, shaking
lips, rubbing his smitten jaw. Hate, scorn, rage
grappled in his soul with his invincible New England
sense of duty, of efficiency, of getting the ship’s work
done. “If they’re goin’ to tow us down to-night,
by joycus, sir, we’ve got to get under way, and be
quick about it!”</p>

<p>Briggs dandled the kris. Its wavy blade, grooved
to hold the dried curaré-poison that need do no more
than scratch to kill, flung out vagrant high-lights in
the gloom.</p>

<p>“For two cents I’d gut you, Mr. Scurlock,” he
retorted. “<i>I’m</i> master of this ship, and she’ll sail
when <i>I’m</i> ready, sir, not before!”</p>

<p>“Captain, they’re only trying to badger-draw you,”
whispered Filhiol in the bucko’s ear. “A man of
your intelligence will beat them at their own game.”
Right well the doctor knew the futility of trying to get
anything forward till the captain’s rage and liquor
should have died. “Let these dogs bark, sir, if they
will. You and I are men of education. I propose
a quiet drink or two, sir, and then a bit of sleep&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean by that, sir?” flared
Briggs, turning on him. “You mean I’m not able to
take my ship out of this devil’s ditch, to-night?”</p>

<p>“Farthest from my thought, captain,” laughed the
doctor. “Of course you can, sir, if you want to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
But this mutinous scum is trying to force your hand.
You’re not the man to let them.”</p>

<p>“I should say <i>not</i>!” swaggered the captain, with
a blasphemy, while low-voiced murmurs ran among the
men,&mdash;dim, half glimpsed figures by the mizzen, or in
the waist. “Not much! Come, doctor!”</p>

<p>He lurched aft, still swinging the kris. Ardently
Filhiol prayed he might gash himself therewith, but
the devil guards his own. With savage grimace at
Scurlock, the physician whispered: “Name o’ God,
man, let him be!” Then, at a discreet distance, he
followed Briggs.</p>

<p>Scurlock nodded, with murder in his eyes. Gascar
and Bevans murmured words that must remain unwritten.
Under the awning at the foot of the forward
companion, white men from the fo’c’sle and
Malays from the deck-house buzzed in divers tongues.
Briggs, the while, was about to enter the after companion
when to his irate ear the sound of a droning
chant, somewhere ashore, came mingled with the dull
thudding of a drum, monotonous, irritating as fever
pulses in the brain of a sick man.</p>

<p>Briggs swerved to the starboard quarter rail and
smote it mightily with his fist, as with bloodshot eyes
he peered down at the smoky, lantern-glowing confusion
of the bund.</p>

<p>“The damned Malays!” he shouted. “They’ve
started another of their infernal sing-songs! If I
could lay hands on that son of a whelp&mdash;”</p>

<p>He shook the kris madly at a little group about a
blazing flare; in the midst squatted an itinerant ballad-singer.
Tapping both heads of a small, barrel-like
drum, the singer whined on and on, with intonations
wholly maddening to the captain.</p>

<p>For a moment Briggs glared down at this scene,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which to his fuddled senses seemed a challenge direct,
especially devil-sent to harry him.</p>

<p>“Look at that now, doctor, will you?” Briggs
flung out his powerful left hand toward the singer.
“Want to bet I can’t throw this knife through the
black dog?”</p>

<p>He balanced the kris, ready for action, and with
wicked eyes gauged the throw. Filhiol raised a disparaging
hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste a splendid curio on the dog, captain,”
smiled he, masking fear with indifference. Should
Briggs so much as nick one of the Malays with that
envenomed blade, Filhiol knew to a certainty that
with fire and sword Batu Kawan would take complete
vengeance. He knew that before morning no white
man would draw life’s breath aboard the <i>Silver Fleece</i>.
“You’ve got a wonderful curio there, sir. Don’t lose
it, for a mere nothing.”</p>

<p>“Curio? What the devil do <i>I</i> care for Malay
junk?” retorted Briggs, thick-tongued and bestial.
“The only place I’d like to see this toothpick would be
stickin’ out of that swine’s ribs!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you don’t realize the value of the knife,
sir,” wheedled Filhiol. “It’s an extraordinarily fine
piece of steel, captain, and the carving of the lotus
bud on the handle is a little masterpiece. I’d like it
for my collection.” He paused, struck by inspiration.
“I’ll play you for the knife, sir. Let’s have that drink
we were speaking of, and then a few hands of poker.
I’ll play you anything I’ve got&mdash;my watch, my instrument
case, my wages for the voyage, whatever you like&mdash;against
that kris. Is that a go?”</p>

<p>“Sheer off!” mocked Briggs, raising the blade.
The doctor’s eye judged distance. He would grapple,
if it came to that. But still he held to craft:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is the first time, captain, I ever knew you to
be afraid of a good gamble.”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Me, afraid?” shouted the drunken man.
“I’ll make you eat those words, sir! The knife
against your pay!”</p>

<p>“Done!” said the doctor, stretching out his hand.
Briggs took it in a grip that gritted the bones of
Filhiol, then for a moment stood blinking, dazed,
hiccoughing once or twice. His purpose, vacillant,
once more was drawn to the singer. He laughed, with
a maudlin catch of the breath.</p>

<p>“<i>Does</i> that gibberish mean anything, doctor?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“Never mind, sir,” answered Filhiol. “We’ve got
a game to play, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not just yet, sir! That damned native may be
laying a curse on me, for all I know. Mr. Scurlock!”
he suddenly shouted forward.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the mate’s voice, through
the gloom.</p>

<p>“Send me a Malay&mdash;one that can talk United
States!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” And Scurlock was heard in converse
with the brown men in the waist. Over the rail the
captain leaned, staring at the singer and the crowd, the
smoky torches, the confused crawling of life in Batu
Kawan; and as he stared, he muttered to himself, and
twisted at his beard with his left hand&mdash;his right
still gripped the kris.</p>

<p>“You damned, outrageous blackguard!” the doctor
thought. “If I ever get you into your cabin, God
curse me if I don’t throw enough opium into you to
keep you quiet till we’re a hundred miles at sea!”</p>

<p>Came the barefoot slatting of a Malay, <i>pad-pad-padding</i>
aft, and the sound of a soft-voiced: “Captain
Briggs, sar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“You the man that Mr. Scurlock sent?” demanded
Briggs.</p>

<p>“Yas, sar.”</p>

<p>“All right. Listen to that fellow down there&mdash;the
one that’s singing!” Briggs laid a hand on the
Malay, jerked him to the rail and pointed a thick,
angry finger. “Tell me what he’s sayin’! Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sar.”</p>

<p>The Malay put both lean, brown hands on the rail,
squinted his gray eyes, impassive as a Buddha’s, and
gave attentive ear. To him arose the droning words
of the long-drawn, musical cadences:</p>

<p class="ppn p1"><i>Arang itou dibasouh dengan ayer<br />
Mawar sakalipoun tiada akan poutih.</i></p>
<p class="ppn2"><i>Satahoun houdjan di langit ayer latout masakan tawar?</i></p>
<p class="ppn"><i>Sebab tiada tahon menari dikatakan tembad.</i></p>
<p class="ppn2"><i>Tabour bidjian diatas tasik tiada akan toumbounh&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="p1">On, on wailed the chant. At last the Malay shook
his head, shrugged thin shoulders under his cotton
shirt, and cast an uneasy glance at Briggs, looming
black-bearded and angry at his side.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s it all about?” demanded the captain,
thudding a fist on the rail. “Sayin’ anythin’ about
me, or the <i>Silver Fleece</i>? If he is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, sar. Nothin’ so, sar.”</p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>“He sing about wicked things. About sin. He
say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> does he say, you cinder from the Pit?”</p>

<p>“He say, you take coal, wash him long time, in
water of roses, coal never get white. Sin always stay.
He say, rain fall long time, one year, ocean never get
fresh water. Always salty water. Sin always stay.
He say one small piece indigo fall in one jar of goat-milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spoil all milk, make all milk blue. One sin last
all life, always.” The Malay paused, trying to
muster his paucity of English. Briggs shook him
roughly, bidding him go on, or suffer harm.</p>

<p>“He say if sky will go to fall down, no man can
hold him up. Sin always fall down. He say, good
seed on land, him grow. Good seed on ocean, him
never grow. He say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do! Stow your jaw, now!”</p>

<p>“Yas, sar.”</p>

<p>“Get out&mdash;go forrard!”</p>

<p>The Malay salaamed, departed. Briggs hailed him
again.</p>

<p>“Hey, you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sar?” answered the brown fellow, wheeling.</p>

<p>“What’s your name&mdash;if pigs have names?”</p>

<p>“Mahmud Baba, sar,” the Malay still replied with
outward calm. Yet to call a follower of the Prophet
“pig” could not by any invention of the mind have
been surpassed in the vocabulary of death-inviting
insult.</p>

<p>“My Mud Baby, eh? Good name&mdash;that’s a slick
one!” And Briggs roared into a laugh of drunken
discord. He saw not that the Malay face was twitching;
he saw not the stained teeth in grimaces of sudden
hate. Gloom veiled this. “I’ll remember that,”
he went on. “My Mud Baby. Well now, Mud
Baby, back to your sty!”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs,” the doctor put in, fair desperate
to get this brute below-decks ere blood should flow.
“Captain, if you were as anxious as I am for a good
stiff game of poker and a stiffer drink, you wouldn’t
be wasting your breath on Malay rubbish. Shall we
mix a toddy for the first one?”</p>

<p>“Good idea, sir!” Briggs answered, his eyes brightening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
He clapped Filhiol on the shoulder, so that the
man reeled toward the after-companion.</p>

<p>Down the stairway they went, the doctor cursing
under his breath, Briggs clumping heavily, singing a
snatch of low ribaldry from a Bombay gambling-hell.
They entered the cabin. To them, as the door closed,
still droned the voice of the minstrel on the bund:</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1"><i>Sebab tiada tahon menari dikatakan tembad,<br />
Tabour bidjian diatas tasik tiada akan toumbounh.</i></p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">One drop of indigo spoils the whole jar of milk;<br />
Seed sown upon the ocean never grows.</p>

<p class="pch">SCURLOCK GOES ASHORE</p>

<p>Sweltering though the cabin was, it seemed to Dr.
Filhiol a blessèd haven of refuge from the probabilities
of grevious harm that menaced, without. With
a deep breath of relief he saw Briggs lay the kris on
the cabin table. Himself, he sat down at that table,
and while Briggs stood there half-grinning with white
teeth through black beard, took up the knife.</p>

<p>He studied it, noting its keen, double edge, its
polished steel, the deft carving of the lotus-bud handle.
Then, as he laid it down, he offered:</p>

<p>“It’s a genuine antique. I’ll go you a month’s
wages against it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothin’ of the kind, sir!” ejaculated
Briggs, and took it up again. “The voyage, you said,
and it’s that or nothing!”</p>

<p>The doctor bit his close-razored lip. Then he nodded.
Filhiol was shrewd, and sober; Briggs, rash
and drunk. Yes, for the sake of getting that cursed
knife out of the captain’s hands, Filhiol would accept.</p>

<p>“Put it out of harm’s way, sir, and let’s deal the
cards,” said he. “It’s poisoned. We don’t want it
where we might get scratched, by accident.”</p>

<p>“Poisoned, sir?” demanded Briggs, running a
horny thumb along the point. His brows wrinkled,
inquisitively. No fear showed in that splendidly male,
lawless, unconquered face.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, captain, put that devilish thing
away!” exclaimed the doctor, feigning to shudder;
though all the while a secret hope was whispering:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heaven send that he may cut himself!” Aloud he
said: “I’ll play no game, sir, with that kris in sight.
Put it in your locker, captain, and set out the drink.
My throat’s afire!”</p>

<p>“Poisoned, eh?” grunted the captain again, still
with drunken obstinacy testing the edge. “All
damned nonsense, sir. After that’s been run into the
Oregon pine of my mizzen, a couple of inches&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s still enough left to put you in a shotted
hammock, sir, if you cut yourself,” the doctor insisted.
“But it’s your own affair. If you choose to have
Mr. Scurlock take the <i>Silver Fleece</i> back to Long
Wharf, Boston, while you rot in Motomolo
Straits&mdash;”</p>

<p>With a blasphemy, Briggs strode to his locker. The
doctor smiled cannily as Briggs flung open the locker,
tossed in the kris and, taking a square-shouldered
bottle, returned to the table. This bottle the captain
thumped down on the table, under the lamp-gleam.</p>

<p>“Best Old Jamaica,” boasted he. “Best is none
too good, when I win my doctor’s entire pay. For
it’s as good as mine already, and you can lay to that!”</p>

<p>Speaking, he worried out the cork. He sniffed at
the bottle, blinked, peered wonderingly at the label,
and sniffed again.</p>

<p>“Hell’s bells!” roared Briggs, flaring into sudden
passion.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, sir?”</p>

<p>“Old Jamaica!” vociferated the captain. “It <i>was</i>
Old Jamaica, but now smell o’ that, will you?”</p>

<p>Filhiol sniffed, tentatively. In a second he knew
some one had been tampering with the liquor, substituting
low-grade spirits for Brigg’s choicest treasure;
but he merely shrugged his shoulders, with:</p>

<p>“It seems like very good rum, sir. Come, let’s
mix our grog and get the cards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good rum!” gibed Briggs. “Some thieving son
of Satan has been at my Jamaica, and has been fillin’
the square-face up with hog-slop, or I never sailed
blue water! <i>Look</i> at the stuff now, will you?”</p>

<p>He spilled out half a glass of the liquor, tasted it,
spat it upon the floor. Then he dashed the glass
violently to the boards, crashing it to flying shards
and spattering the rum all about. In a bull-like roar
he shouted:</p>

<p>“Boy! You, there, boy!”</p>

<p>A moment, and one of the doors leading off the
main cabin opened, on the port side. A pale, slim
boy appeared and advanced into the cabin, blinking
up with fear at the black-bearded vision of wrath.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir? What is it, sir?” asked he, in a scared
voice.</p>

<p>Briggs dealt him a cuff that sent him reeling. The
captain’s huge hand, swinging back, overset the bottle,
that gurgled out its life-blood.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> it?” shouted Briggs. “You got the impudence
to ask me what it is? I’ll learn you to step
livelier when I call, you whelp! Come here!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” quavered the boy. Shaking, he sidled
nearer. “What&mdash;what do you want, sir?”</p>

<p>“What do I <i>want</i>?” the captain howled; while
Filhiol, suddenly pale with a rage that shook his heart,
pressed lips hard together, lest some word escape
them. “You swab! Catechisin’ me, are you? Askin’
<i>me</i> what I want, eh? If I had a rope’s-end here
I’d show you! Get out, now. Go, tell Mr. Scurlock
I want him. Jump!”</p>

<p>The lad ducked another blow, ran to the cabin-door
and sprang for the stairs. Ill-fortune ran at his side.
He missed footing, sprawled headlong up the companion
stairway.</p>

<p>With a shout of exultation, Briggs caught up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a corner a long, smooth stick, with a polished knob
carved from a root&mdash;one of the clubs known in the
Straits as “Penang-lawyers,” by reason of their efficacy
in settling disputes. He grabbed the writhing
boy, now frantically trying to scrabble up the stairs,
in a clutch that almost crunched the frail shoulder
bones. Up the companion he dragged him&mdash;the boy
screaming with terror of death&mdash;and hurled him out
on deck, fair against the wheel.</p>

<p>The boy collapsed in a limp, groaning heap. Briggs
laughed wildly, and, brandishing the Penang-lawyer,
advanced out upon the dim-lit planking.</p>

<p>An arm thrust him back.</p>

<p>“You ain’t goin’ to hit that there boy!” shouted
a voice&mdash;William Scurlock’s. “Not while I’m alive,
you ain’t!”</p>

<p>A wrench and the club flew over the rail. It
splashed in the dark, slow waters of the Timbago.</p>

<p>Briggs gulped. He whirled, both fists knotted.
Then, swift as a cobra, he sprang and struck.</p>

<p>Scurlock dodged. The captain’s fist, finding no
mark, drove against one of the spokes of the wheel
with a crash that split the hickory. As Briggs had
never cursed before, now he cursed. For a second or
two he nursed his damaged hand.</p>

<p>The brief respite sufficed. Scurlock snatched up the
boy. He started forward, just as the doctor appeared
at the top of the companion.</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs, sir!” cried Filhiol, in a shaking
voice. Still he was hoping against hope to keep the
peace. “Are you hurt, sir?”</p>

<p>“To hell with you!” roared Briggs, now forgetting
sea-etiquette&mdash;surest indication of the extremity of
his drunken passion. He lurched after the retreating
Scurlock. “Back, here, you bloody swine! Drop
that brat, and I’ll show you who’s boss!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Scurlock laughed mockingly and quickened his
stride. Mad with the rage that kills, Briggs pursued,
a huge, lunging figure of malevolence and hate. Before
he could lay grips on Scurlock, the mate wheeled.
He let the fainting boy slide down on deck, whipped
out a clasp-knife, snicked open the blade. Holding
it low, to rip upward, he confronted Briggs under the
glimmer of the mizzen-lantern.</p>

<p>Now this was raw mutiny, and a hanging matter
if Scurlock drew one drop of the captain’s blood. But
that Scurlock cared nothing for the noose was very
plain to see. Even the crimson rage of Briggs saw
death knocking at the doors of his life. Barehanded,
he could not close for battle. He recoiled, his bloodshot
eyes shuttling for some handy weapon.</p>

<p>“Damn you, if I had that kris&mdash;” he panted.</p>

<p>“But you ain’t, you lousy bucko!” mocked Scurlock.
“An’ you turn your back on me, to go for it,
if you dare!”</p>

<p>Briggs sprang for the rail. He snatched at a belaying-pin,
with wicked blasphemies. The pin stuck,
a moment. He wrenched it clear, and wheeled&mdash;too
late.</p>

<p>Already Scurlock had snatched up the boy again.
Already he was at the gangway. Down it he leaped,
to the bund. With the unconscious boy still in the
crook of his left arm, he shoved into the scatter of
idling natives. Then he turned, raised a fist of quivering
hatred, and flung his defiance toward the vague,
yellow-clad figure now hesitating at the top of the
gangway, pin in hand:</p>

<p>“I’m through with you, you rum-soaked hellbender!
He’s through, too, the boy is. We’ll take our chances
with the Malays an’ the plague.”</p>

<p>Scurlock’s voice, rising out of the softly-lit tropic
evening, died suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come back, Mr. Scurlock, and bring that boy!”
cried the doctor, from the rail.</p>

<p>“I’ve got nothin’ against you, sir,” answered Scurlock.
“But against <i>him</i>. God! If I come back, it’ll
only be to cut his black heart out an’ throw it to the
sharks. We’re done!”</p>

<p>A moment Briggs stood drunkenly peering, half
minded to pursue, to match his belaying-pin against
the mate’s dirk. Gurgling in his throat&mdash;for excess
of rage had closed upon all speech&mdash;he panted, with
froth upon his black beard, while dim figures along the
rail and on shore waited great deeds. Then all at
once he laughed&mdash;a horrible, deep-throated laugh, rising,
swelling to mighty and bestial merriment; the
laugh of a gorilla, made man.</p>

<p>“The Malays and the plague,” he thickly stammered.
“&mdash;He’s said it&mdash;let ’em go! They’re good
as dead already, and hell take ’em!”</p>

<p>He swung on his heel, then strode back unsteadily
to the companion. Down it he lunged. Still laughing,
he burst into the heat and reek of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Come on, doctor,” cried he, “our cards, our
cards!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CURSE OF NENEK KABAYAN</p>

<p>“He’ll steal no more of my Old Jamaica,” exulted
Briggs, flinging himself into a chair by the table.
“And that sniveling boy will give me no more of
his infernal lip! Skunks!” He picked up the bottle,
still containing a little rum, and poured a gulp of liquor
down his throat. “On my own ship!”</p>

<p>“Where are the cards, sir?” asked Filhiol. His
voice, quivering, was hardly audible.</p>

<p>“Petty game,” burst out the captain, “no good.
Make it a real one, and I’ll go you!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Stakes worth playin’ for! Man-size stakes! You
got money in Boston, sir. Some fifteen thousand.
I’ll play you for that, plus your wages this voyage!”</p>

<p>“Against what, sir?”</p>

<p>“Against my share of the ship’s cargo, and my
share of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>, herself. And if I scuttle
her, as scuttle her I may, in case the insurance money
foots bigger than the ship’s worth and the cargo, I
stake that money, too!”</p>

<p>The doctor pondered a moment, while Briggs pressed
a hand to his thick neck, redly swollen with heat
and rum. Suddenly the captain broke out again:</p>

<p>“That’s an A1 gamble for you, sir. When I land
my West Coast natives at San Felipe, and slip my
opium into Boston, there won’t be a shipmaster walk
up State Street that will be better fixed than I’ll be.”</p>

<p>“Bring out the cards, sir,” answered the doctor.
“But the kris goes in as part of the wager?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, damn it, and I’ll be generous,” slavered
Briggs. He jerked open the table drawer and fetched
out a well-thumbed pack of cards, which he flung on
the green cloth. “I’ll put up a stake that’d make any
man’s mouth water, sir, if he <i>is</i> a man! Though maybe
you’re not, bein’ only a sawbones!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir?”</p>

<p>“The yellow wench asleep in my berth&mdash;Kuala
Pahang!”</p>

<p>“Done!” exclaimed Filhiol, humoring the ruffian to
all possible limits, till liquor and heat should have
overcome him.</p>

<p>“Deal the cards, sir!” cried Briggs. “I may be
a bucko, and I may be drunk to-night, but I know a
man when I see one. I’m not too drunk to add your
wages and your savin’s to my plunder. Deal the
cards!”</p>

<p>Filhiol had just fallen to shuffling the pasteboards
when a groan, from behind the door of the captain’s
private cabin, arrested his hand. Frowning, he
swung around. In his tensing hand the cards bent
almost double.</p>

<p>Briggs buffeted him upon the shoulder, with huge
merriment.</p>

<p>“<i>She’s</i> not dead yet, is she?” exulted he. “No,
no, not yet. Even though everybody in this devil’s
hole claims the wenches will die first, before they’ll
be a white man’s darlin’.” His speech had become
so thick as to be hardly speech at all. “All infernal
liars, sawbones! She’s been here already two days,
Topsy has. An’ is she dead yet? Not very! No,
nor not goin’ to die, neither, an’ you can lay to that!
Nor get away from me. Not while I’m alive, an’
master o’ the <i>Silver Fleece</i>!”</p>

<p>The doctor’s jaw set so hard that his tanned skin
whitened over the maxillary muscles. Very vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Filhiol still perceived the danger of general mutiny, of
mass-attack from Batu Kawan, of fire and sword impending
before the clipper could be got down-river
and away. Come all that might, he must cling to
Briggs, warily, humoringly.</p>

<p>After all, what was one native girl, more or less?
The doctor shuffled the cards again, and dealt, under the
raw light of the swinging-lamp. A louder cry from
the girl turned Briggs around.</p>

<p>“Damnation!” he blared, starting up. “If the
wench gets to howling, she’ll raise the town. I’m
goin’ to shut her jaw, and shut it hard!”</p>

<p>“Quite right, sir,” assented the doctor, though his
deep eyes glowed with murder. “But, why not get
under way, at once, drop down the river to-night,
anchor inside Ulu Salama bar till&mdash;”</p>

<p>Briggs interrupted him with a boisterous laugh.</p>

<p>“Even Reuben Ranzo, the tailor,” he gibed, “could
give you points on navigation!” He stared at Filhiol
a moment, his face darkening; then added harshly:
“You stick to your pills and powders, Mr. Filhiol, or
there’ll be trouble. I won’t have anybody tryin’ to
boss. Now, I’m not goin’ to tell you twice!”</p>

<p>For three heartbeats their eyes met. The doctor’s
had become injected with blood. His face had
assumed an animal expression. Briggs snapped his
thick fingers under the physician’s nose, then turned
with an oath and strode to his cabin door. He
snatched it open, and stood there a moment peering
in, his face deep-lined in a mask of vicious rage.</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs!”</p>

<p>The doctor’s voice brought the ruffian about with
a sharp turn.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> mutinous, too?” shouted he, swinging his
shoulders, loose, hulking, under the yellow silk of
his jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“By no means, sir. As a personal favor to me,
however, I’m asking you not to strike that girl.” The
doctor’s voice was shaking; yet still he sat there at
the table, holding his cards in a quivering hand.</p>

<p>“You look out for your own skin, sawbones!”
Briggs menaced. “The woman’s mine to do with
as I please, an’ it’s nobody’s damn business, you lay
to that! I’ll love her or beat her or throw her to the
sharks, as I see fit. So now you hear me, an’ I warn
you proper, stand clear o’ me, or watch out for
squalls!”</p>

<p>Into the cabin he lunged, just as another door,
opening, disclosed a sleepy-eyed, yellow-haired young
man&mdash;Mr. Wansley, second-mate of the devil-ship.
Wansley stared, and the doctor stood up with doubled
fists, as they heard the sound of blows from within,
then shriller cries, ending in a kind of gurgle&mdash;then
silence.</p>

<p>The doctor gripped both hands together, striving
to hold himself. The life of every white man aboard
now depended absolutely on seeing this thing through
without starting mutiny and war.</p>

<p>“Get back in your cabin, Mr. Wansley, for God’s
sake!” he exclaimed, “or go on deck! The captain’s
crazy drunk. If he sees you here, there’ll be hell to
pay. Get out, quick!”</p>

<p>Wansley grasped the situation and made a speedy
exit up the after-companion, just ahead of Briggs’s return.
The captain banged his cabin door, and staggered
back to the table. He dusted his palms one
against the other.</p>

<p>“The black she-dog won’t whine again, for <i>one</i>
while,” he grinned with white teeth through his mat
of beard. “That’s the only way to teach ’em their
lesson!” He clenched both fists, turning them, admiring
them under the lamp-light. “Great pacifiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
eh, sawbones? <i>I</i> tell you! Beat a dog an’ a woman,
an’ you can’t go far off your course. So now I’ll
deal the cards, an’ win every cent you’ve got!”</p>

<p>“The cards are dealt, sir,” answered Filhiol, chalky
to the lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ you’ve been here with ’em, all alone!”
retorted the captain. “No, sir, that won’t go. Fresh
deal&mdash;here, I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>He gathered the dealt hands and unsteadily began
shuffling, while the doctor, teeth set in lip, swallowed
the affront. Some of the cards escaped the drunken
brute’s thick fingers; two or three dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>“Pick ’em up, sir,” directed Briggs. “No captain
of my stamp bends his back before another man&mdash;an’
besides, I know you’d be glad to knife me, while
I was down!”</p>

<p>Filhiol made no answer. He merely obeyed, and
handed the cards to Briggs, who was about to deal,
when all at once his hands arrested their motion. His
eyes fixed themselves in an incredulous, widening stare,
at the forward cabin door. His massive jaw dropped.
A sound escaped his throat, but no word came.</p>

<p>The doctor spun his chair around. He, too, beheld
a singular apparition; though how it could have got
there&mdash;unless collusion had been at work among the
Malays in the waist&mdash;seemed hard to understand.</p>

<p>So silently the door had slid, that the coming of the
aged native woman had made no sound. Aged she
seemed, incredibly old, wizen, dried; though with these
people who can tell of age? The dim light revealed
her barefooted, clad in a short, gaudily-striped skirt,
a tight-wrapped body-cloth that bound her shrunken
breast. Coins dangled from her ears; her straight
black hair was drawn back flatly; her lips, reddened
with lime and betel, showed black, sharp-filed teeth in
a horrible snarl of hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Silent, a strange yellow ghostlike thing, she crept
nearer. Briggs sprang up, snatched the rum-bottle by
its neck and waited, quivering. Right well he knew
the woman&mdash;old Dengan Jouga, mother of Kuala,
his prey.</p>

<p>For the first time in years unnerved, he stood there.
Had she rushed in at him, screamed, vociferated,
clawed with hooked talons, beaten at him with skinny
fists, he would have knocked her senseless, dragged
her on deck and flung her to the bund; but this cold,
silent, beady-eyed approach took all his sails aback.</p>

<p>Only for a moment, however. Briggs was none
of your impressionable men, the less so when in
drink.</p>

<p>“Get out!” he shouted, brandishing the bottle.
“Out o’ this, or by God&mdash;”</p>

<p>The door, opening again, disclosed the agitated
face of Texel, a foremast hand.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs, sir!” exclaimed this wight, touching
his cap, “one o’ the Malays says <i>she</i>, there, has
got news o’ Mr. Scurlock an’ the boy, sir, that you’ll
want to hear. He’s out here now, the Malay is.
Will I tell him to come in?”</p>

<p>“I could have you flogged, you scum, for darin’
to come into my cabin till you’re called,” shouted
Briggs. “But send the pig in!”</p>

<p>The bottle lowered, as Briggs peered frowning at
the silent hag. Uncanny, this stillness was. Tempests,
hurricanes of passion and of hate would have
quite suited him; but the old Malay crone, standing
there half-way to the table, the light glinting from
her deep coal-black eyes, her withered hands clutching
each other across her wasted body, disconcerted
even his bull-like crassness.</p>

<p>The seaman turned and whistled. At once, a
Malay slid noiselessly in, salaamed and stood waiting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Texel, nervously fingering the cap he held in his
hands, lingered by the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you again, Mud Baby, is it?” cried the
bucko. “What’s the news Dengan Jouga has for
me? Tell her to hand it over an’ then clear out!
Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Captain, sahib, sar,” stammered Mahmud, almost
gray with fear, every lean limb aquiver with the most
extraordinary panic. “She says Mr. Scurlock, an’
boy, him prisoner. You give up girl, Kuala Pahang.
No givem&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sentence ended in a quick stroke of the Malay’s
forefinger across the windpipe, a whistling sound.</p>

<p>Briggs stared and swore. The doctor laid a hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>“Checkmated, sir,” said he. “The old woman
wins.”</p>

<p>“Like hell!” roared the captain. “I don’t know
what the devil she’s talkin’ about. If Scurlock an’
the boy get their fool throats cut, it’s their own fault.
They’re bein’ punished for mutiny. No girl here, at
all! You, Mud Baby, tell that to old Jezebel!”</p>

<p>Mahmud nodded, and slid into a sing-song chatter.
The woman gave ear, all the while watching Briggs
with the unwinking gaze of a snake. She flung back
a few crisp words at Mahmud.</p>

<p>“Well, what now?” demanded Briggs.</p>

<p>“She say, you lie, captain, sar!”</p>

<p>“I <i>lie</i>, do I?” vociferated the bucko. He heaved
the bottle aloft and would have struck the hag full
force, had not the doctor caught his arm, and held it
fast.</p>

<p>“My God, captain!” cried Filhiol, gusty with rage
and fear. “You want mutiny? Want the whole
damned town swarming over us, with torch and
kris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Briggs tried to fling him off, but the doctor clung,
in desperation. Mahmud Baba wailed:</p>

<p>“No, no, captain! No touch her! She very bad
luck&mdash;she Nenek Kabayan!”</p>

<p>“What the devil do <i>I</i> care?” roared Briggs, staggering
as he struggled with the doctor. “She’s got
to get out o’ my cabin, or by&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She’s a witch-woman!” shouted Filhiol, clinging
fast. “That means a witch, Nenek Kabayan does.
If you strike her, they’ll tear your heart out!”</p>

<p>Mahmud, in the extremity of his terror, clasped
thin, brown hands, groveled, clutching at the captain’s
knees. Briggs kicked him away like a dog.</p>

<p>“Get out, you an’ everybody!” he bellowed.
“Doctor, I’ll lay you in irons for this. Into the lazaret
you go, so help me!”</p>

<p>The witch-woman, raising crooked claws against
him, hurled shrill curses at Briggs&mdash;wild, unintelligible
things, in a wail so penetrantly heart-shaking,
that even the captain’s bull-like rage shuddered.</p>

<p>From the floor, Mahmud raised appealing hands.</p>

<p>“She say, give girl or she make <i>orang onto</i> kill
everybody!” cried the Malay. “<i>Orang onto</i>, bad
ghost! She say she make <i>sabali</i>&mdash;sacrifice&mdash;of
everybody on ship.” His voice broke, raw, in a
frenzy of terror. “She say Vishnu lay curse on us,
dead men come out of graves, be wolves, be tigers&mdash;<i>menjelma
kramat</i>&mdash;follow us everywhere!”</p>

<p>“Shut your jaw, idiot!” shouted Briggs, but in a
tone less brutal. The man was shaken. Not all his
bluster could blink that fact. The doctor loosed his
arm; Briggs did not raise the bottle, now, to strike.
On and on wailed Mahmud:</p>

<p>“She say <i>chandra wasi</i>, birds of ocean foam, poison
us, an’ Zemrud, him what keep life, leave us. She
say blind face in sky watch you, cap’n, sahib, an’ laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
an’ you want to die, but you not die. She say you’
life be more poison than <i>katchubong</i> flowers&mdash;she
say evil seed grow in you’ heart, all life long&mdash;she
say somethin’ you love, cap’n, sar, somethin’ you love
more than you’ life, sometime die, an’ you die then
but still you not die! She say&mdash;”</p>

<p>Briggs chewed and spat a curse and, turning to the
table, sat down heavily there. Astonished, Filhiol
stared at him. Never had he seen the captain in this
mood. A wild attack, assault, even murder, would not
have surprised the doctor; but this strange quietude
surpassed belief. Filhiol leaned over Briggs, as he
sat there sagging, staring at the witch-woman still in
furious tirade.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he whispered, “you’re going to give up
the girl, of course? You’re going to save Mr. Scurlock
and the boy, and keep this shriveled monkey of a
witch from raising the town against us?”</p>

<p>Briggs only shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, in a strange, weary voice.
“She can’t have her, an’ that’s flat. I don’t give a
damn for the deserters, an’ if it comes to a fight, we
got our signal-cannon an’ enough small-arms to make
it hot for all the natives between here an’ hell. The
girl’s plump as a young porpoise, an’ she’s mine, an’
I’m going to keep her; you can lay to that!”</p>

<p>Mahmud, still stammering crude translation of the
witch-woman’s imprecations, crawled to Briggs’s feet.
Briggs kicked the man away, once more, and burst
into a jangle of laughter.</p>

<p>“Get ’em all out o’ here, sawbones,” said he, his
head sagging. The life seemed to have departed from
him. “I’m tired of all this hullabaloo.” He opened
his table drawer and drew out an army revolver.
“Three minutes for you to get ’em all out, doctor,
or I begin shootin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the redness of his eye, bleared with drink and
rage, Filhiol read cold murder. He dragged Mahmud
up, and herded him, with Texel and the now
silent witch-woman, out the forward cabin door.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> get out, too!” mouthed the captain, dully.
“I’ll have no sawbones sneakin’ and spyin’ on my
honeymoon. Get out, afore I break you in ways your
books don’t tell you how to fix!”</p>

<p>The doctor gave him one silent look. Then, very
tight-lipped, he issued out beneath the awning, where
among the Malays a whispering buzz of talk was forward.</p>

<p>As he wearily climbed the companion ladder, he
heard the bolt go home, in the cabin door. A dull,
strange laugh reached his ears, with mumbled words.</p>

<p>“God save us, now!” prayed Filhiol, for the first
time in twenty years. “God save and keep us, now!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MALAY FLEET OF WAR</p>

<p>Dawn, leaping out of Motomolo Strait, flinging its
gold-wrought, crimson mantle over an oily sea that
ached with crawling color, found the clipper ship,
whereon rested the curse of old Dengan Jouga, set
fast and fair on the sandspit of Ula Salama, eight
miles off the mouth of the Timbago River.</p>

<p>Fair and fast she lay there, on a tide very near low
ebb, so that two hours or such a matter would float
her again; but in two hours much can happen and much
was destined to.</p>

<p>At the taffrail, looking landward where the sand-dunes
of the river met the sea, and where tamarisk
and mangrove-thickets and pandan-clumps lay dark
against the amethyst-hazed horizon, Dr. Filhiol and
Mr. Wansley&mdash;now first mate of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>,
with Prass installed as second&mdash;were holding moody
speech.</p>

<p>“As luck goes,” the doctor was growling, “this
voyage outclasses anything I’ve ever known. This
puts the climax on&mdash;this Scurlock matter, and the
yellow girl, <i>and</i> going aground.”</p>

<p>“We did the best we could, sir,” affirmed Wansley,
hands deep in jacket pockets. “With just tops’ls an’
fores’ls on her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not criticising your navigation, Mr. Wansley,”
the doctor interrupted. “The old man, of course,
is the only one who knows the bars, and we didn’t
dare wait for him to wake up. Yes, you did very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
well indeed. If you’d been carrying full canvas, you’d
have sprung her butts, when she struck, and maybe
lost a stick or two. Perhaps there’s no great harm
done, after all, if we can hold this damned crew.”</p>

<p>Thus hopefully the doctor spoke, under the long,
level shafts of day breaking along the gold and purple
waters that further off to sea blended into pale greens
and lovely opalescences. But his eyes, turning now
and then towards the ship’s waist, and his ear, keen
to pick up a more than usual chatter down there under
the weather-yellowed awnings, belied his words.</p>

<p>Now, things were making that the doctor knew not
of; things that, had he known them, would have very
swiftly translated his dull anxieties into active fears.
For down the mud-laden river, whose turbid flood
tinged Motomolo Strait with coffee five miles at sea,
a fleet of motley craft was even now very purposefully
making way.</p>

<p>This fleet was sailing with platted bamboo-mats
bellying on the morning breeze, with loose-stepped
masts and curiously tangled rattan cordage; or, in
part, was pulling down-stream with carven oars and
paddles backed by the strength of well-oiled brown
and yellow arms.</p>

<p>A fleet it was, laden to the topmost carving of its
gunwales with deadly hate of the white men. A fleet
hastily swept together by the threats, promises and
curses of old Dengan Jouga, the witch-woman. A
rescue fleet, for the salvation of the yellow girl&mdash;a
fleet grim either to take her back to Batu Kawan, or
else to leave the charred ribs of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>
smoldering on Ulu Salama bar as a funeral pyre over
the bones of every hated <i>orang puti</i>, white man, that
trod her cursèd decks.</p>

<p>Nineteen boats in all there were; seven sail-driven,
twelve thrust along with oars and paddles cunningly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fashioned from teak and <i>tiu</i> wood. These nineteen
boats carried close on three hundred fighting men,
many of them head-hunters lured by the prospect of a
white man’s head to give their sweethearts.</p>

<p>A sinister and motley crew, indeed; some of chief’s
rank, clad in rare feather cloaks, but for the most part
boasting no garment save the <i>de rigueur</i> breech-clout.
Among them rowed no less than eight or ten Mohammedan
<i>amok</i> fanatics, who had sworn on the beard
of the Prophet to take a Frank dog’s life or else to
die&mdash;in either event surely destined for paradise and
the houris’ arms. And one of these fanatics was the
turtle-egg seller, with special hopes in mind which for
the present cannot be divulged.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Dengan Jouga and a lean,
painted <i>pawang</i>, or medicine-man, the war fleet crawled
downstream. Spears, axes, stone and iron maces with
ornate hafts bristled in all the long war-canoes, high-prowed
and gaudy with flaring colors. Blow-guns,
too, were there, carrying venomed darts, and krises
by the score&mdash;wavy-edged blades, heavy and long,
that, driven by a sinewed arm, would slice through
a man’s neck as if it had been <i>ghee</i>, or melted butter;
would open a man’s body broad to the light of day;
or, slashing downward, split him from crown to collar
bone.</p>

<p>The morning shafts of sun glinted, too, on gun-barrels&mdash;old
flintlock muzzle-loaders, with a few antique
East India Company’s rifles that in some obscure
channels of trade had worked their way up the
east coast of the Malay Peninsula to Batu Kawan.
Some bowmen had long arrows wrapped in oil-soaked
cotton pledgets. Such fire-balls, shot into the sun-dried
canvas of the clipper, might go far towards
leaving her bones ableach on Ulu Salama.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. More formidable still was a small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
brass cannon, securely lashed in the bows of a seagoing
proa, its lateen sail all patched with brown and
blue; a proa manned by fifty chosen warriors, and
carrying the medicine man and Dengan Jouga herself.
True, the Malays had only a scant dozen charges for
their ordnance, but if they could catch the hull of the
<i>Silver Fleece</i> between wind and water, as she careened
on the bar, they might so riddle her that the up-coming
tide would pour her full of brine.</p>

<p>Down the fever-smelling river, steaming with heat
and purple haze under the mounting sun, the war-fleet
drove, between lush banks now crowded with sandal
and angsana-trees all clustered with their lolling, yellow
blooms, now mere thickets where apes and screaming
parrots rioted amid snarled labyrinths of lianas,
now sinking into swamps choked with bamboo and
lalang grass.</p>

<p>In some occasional pool, pink lotus-blossoms contrasted
with fragrant charm against the vivid, unhealthy
green of marsh and forest. And, louder than
the crooning war-songs that unevenly drifted on the
shimmering air, the loomlike whir of myriad trumpeter-beetles
blurred the waiting day whose open eye
shrank not from what must be.</p>

<p>Here, there, a fisherman’s hut extended its crazy
platform out over the sullen waters. From such platforms,
yellow-brown folk with braided top-knots
shouted words of good augury to the on-toiling warriors.
Naked, pot-bellied children stood and stared
in awe. Flea-tormented curs barked dolefully. And
from such fisher-boats, as lay anchored in the stream,
rose shouts of joy. For, in the mysterious way of the
Orient, the news of the great, black deed done by the
devil-captain, Briggs Sahib, had already run all down
the Timbago.</p>

<p>Thus the war-fleet labored downward to the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
coming [towards the hour that a landsman would call
eight o’clock,] to salt water. Withered Dengan Jouga,
crouching snake-eyed in the proa, caught sight of the
long, turquoise line that marked the freedom of the
open.</p>

<p>She pointed a skinny arm, flung a word at Akan
Mawar, the medicine man, and clutched more tightly
the thin-bladed knife which&mdash;so all had sworn to her&mdash;she,
and only she, should plunge into the heart of
the black-bearded devil. Silently she waited, as the
seascape broadened. The sunlight, sparkling on that
watery plain, dazzled her eyes like the shimmer of
powdered glass, but still she peered, eager to catch
a glimpse of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>. Her betel-reddened
lips moved again. She whispered:</p>

<p>“My daughter I shall have. His blood, his blood
I shall have, even though he flee from me <i>diatas angin</i>,
beyond the back of the wind! King Surana, who
reigns in the watery depths, will give him to me.
Even though he flee through the Silken Sea, at the
end of the world, I shall have his blood! <i>Tuan Allah
poonia krajah!</i> It is the work of the Almighty.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tuan Allah poonia krajah!</i>” echoed old Akan
Mawar; and other voices raised the supplication.
Back drifted the words from boat to boat; the whole
river murmured with confused echoes: “<i>Tuan Allah
poonia krajah!</i>”</p>

<p>Now silence fell again, but for the lipping of cleft
waters at many prows, the dip of oars, the little
whispering swirl of eddies where paddles lifted.
Bright-yellow sands, here and there gleaming pearl-white
with millions of turtle-eggs, extended seaward
from the river-mouth, pointing like a dagger of menace
at Ulu Salama bar eight miles to sea; the bar that
Alpheus Briggs so easily could have left to starboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
had he not been sleeping off the fumes of samshu in
the cabin with Kuala Pahang.</p>

<p>Cries from the proa and the war-canoes echoed
across the waters. No longer could savagery repress
its rage. Already, far and dim through the set of
haze that brooded over Motomolo Strait, dimming the
liquid light of morning, eyes of eager hate had seen
a distant speck. A tiny blot it was, against the
golden welter on the eastern horizon; a blot whence
rose fine-pricked masts and useless sails.</p>

<p>And spontaneously there rose an antiphonal <i>pantun</i>,
or song of war. Up from the fleet it broke, under the
shrill lead of the hag, now standing with clenched,
skinny fists raised high. She wailed:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Adapoun pipit itou sama pipit djouga!</i></p>

<p class="p1">Others answered. A drum of bamboo, headed with
snake-skin, began to throb.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Dan yang enggang itou sama enggang djouga!</i></p>

<p class="p1">As the echoes died, again rose the witch-woman’s
voice, piercing, resonant:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Bourga sedap dispakey!</i></p>

<p class="p1">The others then:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Layou&mdash;dibouang!</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The song continued, intoned by the witch-woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with choral responses from the fighting men. From
lament it passed to savage threats of death by torture
and by nameless mutilations. Maces began to clatter
on shields, krises to glint in sunlight, severed heads
of enemies to wave aloft on spears.</p>

<p>And out over the liquid rainbow surface of the strait
rolled a long echo, blent of war-cries, shouts of vengeance,
the booming of snake-skin drums&mdash;defiance
of the human wolf-pack now giving wild tongue.</p>

<p>Dr. Filhiol and Mr. Wansley stopped in their speech
and raised peering eyes landward, as some faint verberation
of the war-shout drifted down upon them.
The doctor’s brows drew to a frown; he narrowed
his keen eyes toward the line of hot, damp hills. Mr.
Wansley pushed back his cap and scratched his head.
Together they stood at the rail, not yet glimpsing the
war-fleet which still moved in partial concealment
along the wooded shore.</p>

<p>Into their silence, a harsh, liquor-roughened voice
broke suddenly:</p>

<p>“Empty staring for empty brains! Nothin’ better
to do than look your eyes out at the worst coast, so
help me, God ever made?”</p>

<p>Neither answered. Mr. Wansley surveyed in
silence the hulking, disordered figure now coming forward
from the after companion. The doctor drew a
cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lighted it. Complete
silence greeted Briggs&mdash;silence through which
the vague turmoil trembling across the mother-of-pearl
iridescence of the strait still reached the <i>Silver Fleece</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">COUNCIL OF WAR</p>

<p>A moment the two men eyed the captain. Malay
voices sounded under the awning. Forward, a laugh
drifted on the heat-shimmering air. Briggs cursed,
and still came on.</p>

<p>A sorry spectacle he made, tousled, bleary-eyed, with
pain-contracted forehead where the devil’s own headache
was driving spikes. Right hand showed lacerations,
from having struck the wheel. Heavy shoulders
sagged, head drooped. Angrily he blinked, his
mood to have torn up the world and spat upon the
fragments in very spite.</p>

<p>“Well, lost your tongues, have you?” he snarled.
“I’m used to being answered on my own ship. You,
Mr. Wansley, would do better reading your ’Bow-ditch’
than loafing. And you, doctor, I want you to
mix me a stiff powder for the damnedest headache that
ever tangled my top-hamper. I’ve had a drink or two,
maybe three, already this morning. But that does no
good. Fix me up something strong. Come, stir a
stump, sir! I’m going to be obeyed on my own ship!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the doctor, keeping his tongue
between his teeth, as the saying is. He started aft,
followed by Wansley. Briggs burst out again:</p>

<p>“Insubordination, mutiny&mdash;that’s all I get, this
voyage!” His fists swung, aching for a target.
“Look what’s happened! Against my orders you,
Mr. Wansley, try to take the <i>Fleece</i> to sea. And run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her aground! By God, sir, I could have you disrated
for that! I’d put you in irons for the rest of the
voyage if I didn’t need you on deck. Understand me,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Wansley, with exceeding
meekness. Briggs was about to flare out at him again,
and might very well have come to fist-work, when
a hard, round little concussion, bowling seaward, struck
his ear.</p>

<p>At sound of the shot, the captain swung on his
heel, gripped the rail and stared shoreward.</p>

<p>“What the hell is <i>that</i>?” demanded he, unable to
conceal a sudden fear that had stabbed through the
thrice-dyed blackness of his venom.</p>

<p>“I rather think, sir,” answered Filhiol, blowing a
ribbon of smoke on the still morning air, “it’s trouble
brewing. By Jove, sir&mdash;see that, will you?”</p>

<p>His hand directed the captain’s reddened eyes far
across the strait toward the coastal hills, palm-crowded.
Vaguely the captain saw a long, dim line. At its forward
end, just a speck against the greenery, a triangle
of other color was creeping on. Briggs knew it for the
high sail of a proa.</p>

<p>“H-m!” he grunted. Under the bushy blackness
of his brows he stared with blood-injected eyes. His
muscles tautened. Suddenly he commanded:</p>

<p>“Mr. Wansley, my glass, sir!”</p>

<p>The doctor pursed anxious lips as Wansley departed
toward the companion.</p>

<p>“Trouble, sir?” asked he.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when there’s trouble! How can I
hear anythin’, with your damned jaw-tackle always
busy?”</p>

<p>The doctor shut up, clamwise, and leaned elbows on
the rail, and so they stood there, each peering, each
listening, each thinking his own thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wansley’s return, brass telescope in hand, broke
both lines of reflection. Briggs snatched the glass,
yearning to knock Wansley flat, as he might have done
a cabin-boy. Wansley peered at him with bitter malevolence.</p>

<p>“You hell-devil!” muttered he. “You’ve murdered
two of us already, an’ like as not you’ll murder
all of us before you’re done. If the sharks had you
this minute&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By the Judas priest!” ejaculated Briggs, glass
at eye. He swung it left and right. “Now you
lubberly sons of swabs <i>have</i> got me on a lee-shore with
all anchors draggin’!”</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?” demanded Filhiol, calmly.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> it?” roared the captain, neck and face
scarlet. “After you help run the <i>Silver Fleece</i> on
Ulu Salama bar, where that damned war-party can
close in on her, you ask me what it is! Holy Jeremiah!”</p>

<p>“See here, Captain Briggs.” The doctor’s voice
cut incisively. “If that’s a war-party, we’ve got no
time to waste in abuse. Please let me use that glass
and see for myself.”</p>

<p>“Use nothing!” shouted Briggs. “What? Call
me a liar, do you? I tell you it <i>is</i> a war-party with
five&mdash;eight&mdash;twelve&mdash;well, about sixteen boats and
a proa, I make it; and you stand there and call me a
liar!”</p>

<p>“I call you nothing, sir,” retorted the physician, his
face impassive. In spite of anger, Filhiol comprehended
that he and Briggs represented the best brain-power
on the clipper. Under the urge of peril these
two must temporarily sink all differences and stand
together. “You say there’s a war-party coming out.
I place myself at your orders.”</p>

<p>“Same here, sir,” put in Mr. Wansley. “What’s to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be done, sir?” Urgent peril had stifled the fires of
hate.</p>

<p>“Call Mr. Prass and Mr. Crevay,” answered the
captain, sobered. “You, doctor, mix me up that
powder, quick. Here, I’ll go with you. You’ve got
to stop this damned headache of mine! Look lively,
Mr. Wansley! Get Bevans, too, and Gascar!”</p>

<p>In five minutes the war-council was under way on
the after-deck. Already the doctor’s drug had begun
to loosen the bands of pain constricting the captain’s
brow. Something of Briggs’s normal fighting energy
was returning. The situation was already coming
under his strong hand.</p>

<p>Careful inspection through the glass confirmed the
opinion that a formidable war-fleet was headed
toward Ulu Salama bar. The far, vague sound of
chanting and of drums clinched matters.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to meet ’em with all we’ve got,” said
Briggs, squinting through the tube. “There’s a few
hundred o’ the devils. Our game is to keep ’em from
closing in. If they board us&mdash;well, they aren’t goin’
to, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the look o’ things forrard, sir,” put
in Crevay, now bo’sun of the clipper, filling the position
that Prass had vacated in becoming second mate.
“Them Malays, sir&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s the hell of it, I know,” said Briggs. He
spoke rationally, sobered into human decency. “If
we had a straight white crew, we could laugh at the
whole o’ Batu Kawan. But our own natives are
liable to run <i>amok</i>.”</p>

<p>“We’d better iron the worst of ’em, sir, an’ clap
hatches on ’em,” suggested Crevay. “There’s seventeen
white men of us, an’ twenty natives. If we had
more whites, I’d say shoot the whole damn lot o’
Malays an’ chuck ’em over to the sharks while there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
time!” His face was deep-lined, cruel almost as the
captain’s.</p>

<p>Silence followed. Gascar nodded approval, Bevans
went a trifle pale, and Wansley shook his head. Prass
turned his quid and spat over the rail; the doctor
glanced forward, squinting with eyes of calculation.
Under the brightening sun, each face revealed the varying
thoughts that lay in each man’s heart. Filhiol was
first to speak.</p>

<p>“Those Malays are valuable to us,” said he. “They
make excellent hostages, if properly restrained in the
hold. But we can’t have them at large.”</p>

<p>“We can, and must, all of ’em!” snapped Briggs.
His eye had cleared and once more swept up the situation
with that virile intelligence which long had made
him a leader of men. His nostrils widened, breathing
the air of battle. His chest, expanding, seemed a
barrier against weakness, indecision. The shadow of
death had blotted out the madness of his orgy. He
stood there at the rail, erect, square-jawed, a man once
more. A man that even those who most bitterly
hated him now had to respect and to obey.</p>

<p>“We need ’em all,” he repeated, with the resonance
of hard decision. “We’re short-handed as it is. We
need every man-jack of them, but not to fight. They
won’t fight for us. We daren’t put so much as a clasp-knife
in their murderin’ hands. But they can work
for us, and, by the Judas priest, they shall! Our pistols
can hold ’em to it. Work, sweat, damn ’em&mdash;sweat
the yellow devils, as they never sweat before!”</p>

<p>“How so, captain?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“It’ll be an hour before that fleet lays alongside.
There’s a good chance we can kedge off this damned
bar. Twenty natives at the poop capstan, with you,
Mr. Bevans&mdash;and I guess I’ll let the doctor lend a
hand, too&mdash;standing over ’em with cold lead&mdash;that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the game.” Briggs laughed discordantly. “How’s
your nerve, Mr. Bevans? All right, sir?”</p>

<p>Sea-etiquette was returning. Confidence brightened.</p>

<p>“Nerve, sir? All right!”</p>

<p>“Ever shoot a man dead in his tracks?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then you’ll do!” Briggs slapped Bevans
on the shoulder. “I’ll put you and the doctor in charge
of the natives. First one that raises a hand off a
capstan-bar, drill him through the head. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Bevans. The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s settled! To work! We won’t want the
natives at large, though, till we get the kedge over.
We’ll keep ’em in the ’midships deck-house for a while
yet. Doctor, you stand at the break and shoot the
first son of a hound that sticks his nose out. Mr.
Wansley, muster all the white men aft for instructions.
Mr. Prass, take what men you need and get up all the
arms and ammunition. First thing, get out that stand
of rifles in my cabin. Here’s two keys. One is my
private locker-key, and the other the key to the arms-locker.
In my locker you’ll find a kris. In the other,
three revolvers. Bring those.” The captain’s words
came crisp, sharp, decisive. “Bring up the six navy
cutlasses from the rack in the cabin. Mr. Gascar will
help you. Mr. Gascar, how many axes have you got
in your carpenter’s chest?”</p>

<p>“Four, sir, and an adz.”</p>

<p>“Bring ’em all. Tell the cook to boil every drop of
water he’s got room for on the galley range. Get the
marline spikes from the bo’sun’s locker and lay ’em
handy. Cast loose the signal-gun lashed down there
on the main deck. We’ll haul that up and mount it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the taffrail. God! If they want war, they’ll get it,
the black scuts!”</p>

<p>“We’re short of round-shot for the gun, sir,” said
“Chips.” “I misdoubt there’s a dozen rounds.”</p>

<p>“No matter. Solid shot isn’t much good for this
work. Get all the bolts, nuts and screws from your
shop&mdash;all the old iron junk you can ram down her
throat. How’s powder?”</p>

<p>“Plenty, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! We’ve got powder enough, men enough
and guts enough. To your work. Mr. Crevay!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” A lank, bony man, Crevay, with fiery
locks and a slashed cheek where a dirk had once ripped
deep. An ex-navy man he, and of fighting blood.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to have you serve the gun when ready.
You and any men you pick,” the captain told him,
while the others departed each on his own errand,
tensely, yet without haste or fear. “Meanwhile, I’ll
put you in charge of kedgin’ us off. Cast loose and
rig the kedge-anchor, lower it away from that davy
there to the long-boat, and sink it about a hundred
fathom off the starb’d quarter. With twenty Malays
at the capstan-bars, we ought to start the <i>Fleece</i>. If
not, we’ll shift cargo from forrard. Look alive, sir!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” And Crevay, too, departed, filled
with the energy that comes to every man when treated
like a man and given a man’s work to do.</p>

<p>As by a miracle, the spirit of the <i>Silver Fleece</i> had
changed. Discipline had all come back with a rush;
the battling blood had risen. No longer, for the moment,
were the captain’s heavy crimes and misdemeanors
held against him. Briggs stood for authority,
defense in face of the peril of death. His powerful
body and stern spirit formed a rallying-point
for every white man aboard. And even those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had most poisonously grisled in their hearts against
the man, now ran loyally to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Forgotten was the cause of all this peril&mdash;the
stealing of Kuala Pahang, in drunken lust. Forgotten
the barbarities that had driven Mr. Scurlock and
the boy ashore. Forgotten the brutal cynicism that
had refused to buy their liberty at the price of giving
up the girl. Of all these barbarities, no memory
seemed now to survive. The deadly menace of
twenty Malays already growling in the waist of the
ship, and of the slow-advancing line of war-canoes,
banished every thought save one&mdash;battle!</p>

<p>Once more Captain Alpheus Briggs had proved himself,
in time of crisis, a man; more than a man&mdash;a
master of men.</p>

<p>Thus, now, swift preparations had begun to play
the game of war in which no quarter would be asked
or given.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">BEFORE THE BATTLE</p>

<p>Strenuous activities leaped into being, aboard the
stranded clipper ship.</p>

<p>All the Malays were herded in the deck-house, informed
that they were sons of swine and that the
first one who showed a face on deck, till wanted,
would be shot dead. The doctor, with a revolver
ready for business, added weight to this information.</p>

<p>Under the orders of Mr. Wansley, all the white
sailors came trooping aft. Noisily and profanely they
came, making a holiday of the impending slaughter.
A hard company they were, many in rags, for Briggs
could never have been called other than conservative
regarding credits from the slop-chest. Rum, however,
he now promised them, and whatever loot they could
garner from the Malay fleet; so they cheered him
heartily. They, too, had all become his men.</p>

<p>Bad men they looked, and such as now were needed&mdash;three
or four Liverpool guttersnipes, a Portuguese
cut-throat from Fayal, a couple of Cayman wreckers,
a French convict escaped from the penal ship at Marseilles,
and the rest low-type American scum. For
such was the reputation of Alpheus Briggs, all up and
down the Seven Seas, that few first-class men ever
willingly shipped with him before the mast.</p>

<p>Workers and fighters they were, though, every one.
While black smoke began to emerge from the galley
funnel, on the shimmering tropic air, as the cook
stuffed oily rags and oil-soaked wood under all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
coppers that his range would hold, divers lines of
preparation swiftly developed.</p>

<p>Already some were casting loose the lashings of
the signal-gun and rigging tackle to hoist the rust-red
old four-inch piece to the after-deck. Others fell to
work with Mr. Crevay, rigging the kedge-anchor or
lowering away the long-boat. Another gang leaped to
the task of getting above-decks all the rifles, cutlasses,
powder, ball-shot and iron junk, the axes and revolvers;
of loading everything, even of laying belaying-pins
handy as a last line of hand-to-hand weapons.</p>

<p>Briggs supervised all details, even to the arming
of each man with the butchering-tool he claimed to be
most expert with. The best were given the rifles;
to those of lesser skill was left the cutlass work. A
gun crew of two men was picked to serve the cannon
with Mr. Crevay. Three were detailed to help the
cook carry boiling water.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bevans will stand over the natives at the capstan,”
directed Briggs. “And you, doctor, will act
in your medical capacity when we get into action.
If hard-driven, you can be useful with the kris, eh?
Quite in your line, sir; quite in your line.”</p>

<p>Briggs smiled expansively. All his evil humors
had departed. The foretaste of battle had shaken him
clean out of his black moods. His genius for organizing,
for leading men, seemed to have expanded
him to heroic proportions. In his deep, black eyes,
the poise of his head, the hard, glad expression of his
full-blooded, black-bearded face, one saw eager virility
that ran with joy to meet the test of strength, and that
exulted in a day’s work of blood.</p>

<p>A heroic figure he, indeed&mdash;thewed like a bull;
with sunlight on face and open, corded neck; deep-chested,
coatless now, the sleeves of his pongee shirt
rolled up to herculean elbows. Some vague perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
crossed the doctor’s mind that here, indeed, stood
an anomaly, a man centuries out of time and place,
surely a throwback to some distant pirate strain of
the long-vanished past.</p>

<p>Imagination could twist a scarlet kerchief ’round
that crisp-curling hair, knot a sash about the captain’s
waist, draw high boots up to his powerful knees.
Imagination could transport him to the coasts of Mexico
long, long ago; imagination could run the Jolly
Roger to the masthead&mdash;and there, in Captain Briggs,
merchant-ship master of the year 1868, once more
find kith and kin of Blackbeard, Kidd, Morgan, England,
and all others of the company of gentlemen
rovers in roistering days.</p>

<p>Something of this the doctor seemed to understand.
Yet, as he turned his glance a moment to the line of
war-craft now more plainly visible across the shimmering
nacre of the strait, he said, raising his voice
a trifle by reason of the various shouts, cries and diverse
noises blending confusedly, and now quite obliterating
all sounds from the war fleet:</p>

<p>“You know what those canoes are coming after,
of course.”</p>

<p>“The girl! What of it?”</p>

<p>“And you know, sir, that old Dengan Jouga is
bound to be aboard. There’ll be a medicine man
or two, as well.”</p>

<p>“What the devil are you driving at?” demanded
Briggs.</p>

<p>“That’s a formidable combination, sir,” continued
the doctor. “We’ve got twenty Malays on board
that will face hell-fire itself rather than see any harm
befall a native <i>pawang</i> or a witch-woman. We’ll
never be able to hold them to any work. Each of
them believes he can reach paradise by slaughtering
a white man. In addition, he can avenge harm done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the old woman and the girl. Under those circumstances&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By God, sir, if I didn’t need you, sir&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Under those circumstances, my original suggestion
of holding them all under hatches, as hostages,
has much to recommend it, if we come to a fight. But
need we come to a fight? Need we, sir?”</p>

<p>“How the devil can we sheer off from it?”</p>

<p>“By giving up the girl, sir. Put her in one of the
small boats with a few trade-dollars and trinkets for
her dowry&mdash;which will effectually lustrate the girl,
according to these people’s ideas&mdash;and give her a
pair of oars. She’ll take care of herself all right.
The war-fleet will turn around and go back, which will
be very much better, sir, than slaughter. We’ve already
lost two men, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you’re white-livered enough to stand there
and advise taking no revenge for them?” interrupted
Briggs, his voice gusty with sudden passion.</p>

<p>Briggs struck the rail with the flat of his palm, a
blow that cracked like a pistol-shot; while the doctor,
wholly unhorsed by this tilt from so unexpected an
angle, could only stare.</p>

<p>“By the Judas priest, sir!” cried Briggs furiously.
“That’s enough to make a man want to cut you down
where you stand, sir, you hear <i>me</i>? And if that yellow-bellied
cowardice wasn’t enough, you ask me to
give up the girl&mdash;the girl that’s cost me two men
already&mdash;the girl that may yet cost me my ship and
my own life! Well, by the Judas priest!”</p>

<p>“Don’t risk your life and the ship for a native
wench!” cut in the doctor with a rush of indignation.
“There are wenches by the score, by the hundred, all
up and down the Straits. You can buy a dozen, for
a handful of coin. Wenches by the thousands&mdash;but
only one <i>Silver Fleece</i>, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Devilish lot you care about the <i>Fleece</i>!” snarled
Briggs. “Or about anything but your own cowardly
neck!”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs, don’t forget yourself!”</p>

<p>“Hell’s bells! They shan’t have that girl. Witch-women,
medicine men or all the devils of the Pit
shan’t take her back. She’s mine, I tell you, and
before I’ll let her go I’ll throw her to the sharks myself.
Sharks enough, and plenty&mdash;there’s one now,”
he added, jerking his hand at a slow-moving, black
triangle that was cutting a furrow off to starboard.
“So I want to hear no more from you about the girl,
and you can lay to that!”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and strode aft, growling in
his beard. The doctor, peering after him with
smoldering eyes, felt his finger tighten on the trigger.
One shot might do the business. It would mean death,
of course, for himself. The courts would take their
full penalty, all in due time; but it would save the ship
and many white men’s lives.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the doctor did not raise his weapon.
Discipline still held; the dominance of that black-bearded
Hercules still viséed all opposition into impotence.
With no more than a curse, the doctor turned
back to his guard duty.</p>

<p>“Are you man or are you devil?” muttered Filhiol.
“Good God, what <i>are</i> you?”</p>

<p>Already the defense of the <i>Silver Fleece</i> was nearly
complete; and in the long-boat the kedge-anchor was
being rowed away by four men under command of
Mr. Crevay. The war-fleet had drawn much nearer,
in a rough crescent to northwestward, its sails taut.
Flashing water-jewels, swirled up from paddles, had
become visible, under the now unclouded splendor
of the sun. More and more distinctly the chanting
and war-drums drifted in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The off-shore breeze was urging the armada forward;
the dip and swing of all those scores of paddles
gave a sense of unrelenting power. But Briggs, hard,
eager, seemed only welcoming battle as he stood calculating
time and distance, armament and disposal
of his forces, or, with an eye aloft at the clewed-up
canvas, figured the tactics of kedging-off, of making
sail if possible, and showing Batu Kawan’s forces a
clean pair of heels.</p>

<p>“Look lively with that anchor!” he shouted out
across the sparkling waters. “Drop her in good holdin’
ground, and lead that line aboard. The sooner we
get our Malays sweatin’ on the capstan, the better!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” drifted back the voice of Crevay.
And presently the splash of the anchor as the boat-crew
tugged it over the stern, flung cascades of foam
into the heat-quivering air.</p>

<p>The boat surged back bravely; the line was bent to
the capstan, and Briggs ordered the Malays to the
bars. Sullen they came, shuffling, grumbling strange
words&mdash;lean, brown and yellow men in ragged cotton
shirts and no shirts at all&mdash;as murderous a pack as
ever padded in sandals or bare feet along white decks.</p>

<p>Among them slouched Mahmud Baba, who, like all
the rest, shot a comprehending glance at the on-drawing
fleet. Up the forward companion-ladder they
swarmed, and aft to the capstan, with Briggs, the doctor
and Wansley all three on a hair-trigger to let
sunlight through the first who should so much as raise
a hand of rebellion. And so they manned the capstan-bars,
and so they fell a-heaving at the kedge-line,
treading with slow, toilsome feet ’round and ’round on
the hot planks, where&mdash;young as the morning was&mdash;the
pitch had already softened.</p>

<p>“Come here, you <i>surkabutch</i>!” commanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
captain, summoning Mahmud Baba. “<i>Juldi,
idherao!</i>”</p>

<p>The Malay came, gray with anger&mdash;for Briggs
had, in hearing of all his fellows, called him “son of
a pig,” and a Mohammedan will kill you for calling
him that, if he can. Nevertheless, Mahmud salaamed.
Not now could he kill. Later, surely. He could
afford to wait. The Frank must not call him son
of a pig, and still live. Might not Allah even now be
preparing vengeance, in that war-fleet? Mahmud
salaamed again, and waited with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>At the capstan the <i>thud-thud-thud</i> of twoscore
trampling feet was already mingling with a croon of
song, that soon would rise and strengthen, if not
summarily suppressed, and drift out to meet the war-chant
of the warrior blood-kin steadily approaching.</p>

<p><i>Click-click-click</i>! the pawl and ratchet punctuated the
rhythm of feet and song, as the hawser began to rise,
dripping, from the sea. Briggs drew his revolver
from his belt, and ground the muzzle fair against
Mahmud’s teeth.</p>

<p>“You tell those other <i>surkabutchas</i>,” said he with
cold menace, “that I’ll have no singing. I’ll have no
noise to cover up your plotting and planning together.
You’ll all work in silence or you’ll all be dead. Understand
me?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sar.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll hang to the capstan-bars till we’re
free, no matter what happens. The first man that
quits, goes to glory on the jump. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sar.” Mahmud’s voice was low, submissive;
but through the drooping lids a gleam shone forth
that never came from sunlight or from sea.</p>

<p>“All right,” growled Briggs, giving the revolver
an extra shove. “Get to work! And if those other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
sons of pigs in the canoes board us, we white men
will shoot down every last one o’ <i>you</i> here. We’ll
take no chances of being knifed in the back. <i>You’ll</i>
all have gone to damnation before one o’ <i>them</i> sets
foot on my decks. You lay to that, my Mud Baby!
Now, tell ’em all I’ve told you, and get it straight!
<i>Jao!</i>”</p>

<p>Briggs struck Mahmud a head-cracking blow with
the revolver just above the ear and sent him staggering
back to the capstan. The song died, as Mahmud
gulped out words that tumbled over each other with
staccato vehemence.</p>

<p>“Get in there at the bars!” shouted Briggs. “Get
to work, you, before I split you!”</p>

<p>Mahmud swung to place, and bent his back to labor,
as his thin chest and skinny hands pushed at the bar
beside his fellows.</p>

<p>And steadily the war-fleet drew in toward its prey.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">PARLEY AND DEATH</p>

<p>In silence now the capstan turned. No Malays
hummed or spoke. Only the grunting of their breath,
oppressed by toil and the thrust of the bars, kept
rough time with the slither of feet, the ratchet-click,
the groaning creak of the cable straining through the
chocks.</p>

<p>“Dig your toe-nails in, you black swine!” shouted
Briggs. “The first one that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs,” the doctor interrupted, taking
him by the arm, “I think the enemy’s trying to communicate
with us. See there?”</p>

<p>He pointed where the fleet had now ranged up to
within about two miles. The mats of the proa and of
the other sailing-canoes had crumpled down, the oars
and paddles ceased their motion. The war-party
seemed resting for deliberation. Only one boat was
moving, a long canoe with an outrigger; and from
this something white was slowly waving.</p>

<p>“Parley be damned!” cried Briggs. “The only
parley I’ll have with that pack of lousy beggars will
be hot shot!”</p>

<p>“That canoe coming forward there, with the white
flag up,” Filhiol insisted, “means they want to powwow.
It’s quite likely a few dollars may settle the
whole matter; or perhaps a little surplus hardware.
Surely you’d rather part with something than risk
losing your ship, sir?”</p>

<p>“I’ll part with nothin’, and I’ll save my ship into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the bargain,” growled the captain. “There’ll be no
tribute paid, doctor. Good God! White men knucklin’
under, to niggers? Never, sir&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>Savagely he spoke, but Filhiol detected intonations
that rang not quite true. Again he urged: “A bargain’s
a bargain, black or white. Captain Light was
as good a man as ever sailed the Straits, and <i>he</i> wasn’t
above diplomacy. He understood how to handle these
people. Wanted a landing-place cleared, you remember.
Couldn’t hire a man-jack to work for him, so
he loaded his brass cannon with trade-dollars and
shot them into the jungle. The Malays cleared five
acres, hunting for those dollars. These people can be
handled, if you know how.”</p>

<p>The captain, his heavy brows furrowed with a black
frown, still peered at the on-drawing canoe. Silence
came among all the white men at their fighting-stations
or grouped near the captain.</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” burst out Briggs. “Silence, sir!
Mr. Gascar, fetch my glass!”</p>

<p>The doctor, very wise, held his tongue. Already he
knew he was by way of winning his contention. Gascar
brought the telescope from beside the after-companion
housing, where Briggs had laid it. The captain
thrust his revolver into his belt. In silence he
studied the approaching canoe. Then he exclaimed:
“This is damned strange! Dr. Filhiol!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“Take a look, and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>He passed the telescope to the doctor, who with
keenest attention observed the boat, then said:</p>

<p>“White men on board that canoe. Two of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s what <i>I</i> thought, doctor. Must be Mr.
Scurlock and the boy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I think there’s still time to trade the
girl for them,” the doctor eagerly exclaimed. A moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Briggs seemed pondering, while at the capstan
the driven Malays&mdash;now reeking in a bath of sweat&mdash;still
trod their grunting round.</p>

<p>“Captain, I beg of you&mdash;” the doctor began.
Briggs raised a hand for silence.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste your breath, sir, till we know what’s
what!” he commanded. “I’ll parley, at any rate.
We may be able to get that party on board here. If
we can, the rest will be easy. And I’m as anxious
to lay hands on those damned deserters o’ mine as
I was ever anxious for anything in my life. Stand to
your arms, men! Mr. Bevans, be ready with that signal-gun
to blow ’em out of the water if they start
trouble. Mr. Gascar, fetch my speakin’-trumpet
from the cabin. Bring up a sheet, too, from Scurlock’s
berth. That’s the handiest flag o’ truce we’ve
got. Look alive now!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Gascar, and departed on
his errand.</p>

<p>Silence fell, save for the toiling Malays, whose
labors still were fruitless to do aught save slowly drag
the kedge through the gleaming sand of the sea-bottom.
Mr. Wansley muttered something to himself;
the doctor fell nervously to pacing up and down; the
others looked to their weapons.</p>

<p>From the fleet now drifted no sound of drums or
chanting. In stillness lay the war-craft; in stillness
the single canoe remained on watch, with only that
tiny flicker of white to show its purpose. A kind of
ominous hush brooded over sea and sky; but ever the
tramp of feet at the capstan, and the panting breath
of toil there rose on the superheated air.</p>

<p>Gascar returned, handed the trumpet to Briggs, and
from the rail waved the sheet. After a minute the
canoe once more advanced, with flashing paddles.
Steadily the gun-crew kept it covered, ready at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
word to shatter it. Along the rail the riflemen
crouched. And still the little white flutter spoke of
peace, if peace the captain could be persuaded into
buying.</p>

<p>The glass now determined beyond question that Mr.
Scurlock and the boy were on board. Briggs also
made out old Dengan Jouga, the witch-woman, mother
of the girl. His jaw clamped hard as he waited. He
let the war-craft draw up to within a quarter-mile,
then bade Gascar cease displaying the sheet, and
through the speaking-trumpet shouted:</p>

<p>“That’ll do now, Scurlock! Nigh enough!
What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>The paddlers ceased their work. The canoe drifted
idly. Silence followed. Then a figure stood up&mdash;a
figure now plainly recognizable in that bright glow
as Mr. Scurlock. Faintly drifted in the voice of the
former mate:</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs! For God’s sake, listen to me!
Let me come closer&mdash;let me talk with you!”</p>

<p>“You’re close enough now, you damned mutineer!”
retorted Briggs. “What d’ you want? Spit it out,
and be quick about it!”</p>

<p>Another silence, while the sound traveled to the
canoe and while the answer came:</p>

<p>“I’ve got the boy with me. We’re prisoners. If
you don’t give up that girl, an’ pay somethin’ for her,
they’re goin’ to kill us both. They’re goin’ to cut our
heads off, cap’n, and give ’em to the witch-woman, to
hang outside her hut!”</p>

<p>“And a devilish good place for ’em, too!” roared
Briggs, unmindful of surly looks and muttered words
revealing some disintegration of the discipline at first
so splendidly inspired. “I’ll have no dealin’s with
you on such terms. Get back now&mdash;back, afore I
sink you, where you lie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“See here, captain!” burst out Filhiol, his face
white with a flame of passion. “I’m no mutineer,
and I’m not refusing duty, but by God&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, sir!” shouted Briggs. “I’ve got irons
aboard for any man as sets himself against me!”</p>

<p>“Irons or no irons, I can’t keep silent,” the doctor
persisted, while here and there a growl, a curse, should
have told Briggs which way the spate of things had
begun to flow. “That man, there, and that helpless
boy&mdash;”</p>

<p>He choked, gulped, stammered in vain for words.</p>

<p>“They’ll hang our heads up, and they’ll burn the
<i>Silver Fleece</i> and bootcher all hands,” drifted in the
far, slow cry of Mr. Scurlock. “They got three
hundred men an’ firearms, an’ a brass cannon. An’
if this party is beat, more will be raised. This is your
last chance! For the girl an’ a hundred trade-dollars
they’ll all quit and go home!”</p>

<p>“To hell with ’em!” shouted Briggs at the rail,
his face swollen with hate and rage. “To hell with
you, too! There’ll be no such bargain struck so long
as I got a deck to tread on, or a shot in my lockers!
If they want the yellow she-dog, let ’em come an’ take
her! Now, stand off, there, afore I blow you to Davy
Jones!”</p>

<p>“It’s murder!” flared the doctor. “You men,
here&mdash;officers of this ship&mdash;I call on you to witness
this cold-blooded murder. Murder of a good
man, and a harmless boy! By God, if you stand there
and let him kill those two&mdash;”</p>

<p>Briggs flung up his revolver and covered the doctor
with an aim the steadiness of which proved how unshaken
was his nerve.</p>

<p>“Murder if you like,” smiled he with cold malice,
his white teeth glinting. “An’ there’ll be another one
right here, if you don’t put a stopper on that mutinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
jaw of yours and get back to your post. That’s my
orders, and if you don’t obey on shipboard, it’s mutiny.
Mutiny, sawbones, an’ I can shoot you down, an’ go
free. I’m to windward o’ the law. Now, get back
to the capstan, afore I let daylight through you!”</p>

<p>Outplayed by tactics that put a sudden end to any
opposition, the doctor ceded. The steady “O” of
the revolver-muzzle paralyzed his tongue and numbed
his arm. Had he felt that by a sudden shot he could
have had even a reasonable chance of downing the
captain, had he possessed any confidence of backing
from enough of the others to have made mutiny a
success, he would have risked his life&mdash;yes, gladly
lost it&mdash;by coming to swift grips with the brute.
But Filhiol knew the balance of power still lay against
him. The majority, he sensed, still stood against him.
Sullenly the doctor once more lagged aft.</p>

<p>From the canoe echoed voices, ever more loud and
more excited. In the bow, Scurlock gesticulated.
His supplications were audible, mingled with shouts
and cries from the Malays. Added thereto were high-pitched
screams from the boy&mdash;wild, shrill, nerve-breaking
screams, like those of a wounded animal
in terror.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, this is horrible!” groaned the doctor,
white as paper. His teeth sank into his bleeding lip.
He raised his revolver to send a bullet through the
captain; but Crevay, with one swift blow, knocked the
weapon jangling to the deck, and dealt Filhiol a blow
that sent him reeling.</p>

<p>“Payne, and you, Deming, here!” commanded he,
summoning a couple of foremast hands. They came
to him. “Lock this man in his cabin. He’s got a
touch o’ sun. Look alive, now!”</p>

<p>Together they laid hands on Filhiol, hustled him
down the after-companion, flung him into his cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and locked the door. Crevay, guarding the Malays at
the capstan, muttered:</p>

<p>“Saved the idiot’s life, anyhow. Good doctor;
but as a man, what a damned, thundering fool!”</p>

<p>Unmindful of this side-play Briggs was watching
the canoe. His face had become that of a devil glad
of vengeance on two hated souls. He laughed again
at Scurlock’s up-flung arms, at his frantic shout:</p>

<p>“For the love o’ God, captain, save us! If you
don’t give up that girl, they’re goin’ to kill us right
away! You got to act quick, now, to save us!”</p>

<p>“Save yourselves, you renegades!” shouted Briggs,
swollen with rage and hate. His laugh chilled the
blood. “You said you’d chance it with the Malays
afore you would with me. Well, take it, now, and to
hell with you!”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, captain&mdash;”</p>

<p>Scurlock’s last, wild appeal was suddenly strangled
into silence. Another scream from the boy echoed
over the water. The watchers got sight of a small
figure that waved imploring arms. All at once this
figure vanished, pulled down, with Scurlock, by shouting
Malays.</p>

<p>The exact manner of the death of the two could
not be told. All that the clipper’s men could see was
a sudden, confused struggle, that ended almost before
it had begun. A few shouts drifted out over the clear
waters. Then another long, rising shriek in the boy’s
treble, shuddered across the vacancy of sea and sky&mdash;a
shriek that ended with sickening suddenness.</p>

<p>Some of the white men cursed audibly. Some faces
went drawn and gray. A flurry of chatter broke out
at the toiling capstan&mdash;not even Mr. Crevay’s furious
oaths and threats could immediately suppress it.</p>

<p>Briggs only laughed, horribly, his teeth glinting as
he leaned on the rail and watched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment the canoe rocked in spite of its
steadying outrigger, with the violence of the activities
aboard it. Then up rose two long spears; spears topped
with grisly, rounded objects. A rising chorus of yells,
yells of rage, hate, defiance, spread abroad, echoed by
louder shouts from the wide crescent of the fleet. And
once again the drums began to pulse.</p>

<p>From the canoe, two formless things were thrown.
Here, there, a shark-fin turned toward the place&mdash;a
swirl of water.</p>

<p>Silence fell aboard the clipper. In that silence a
slight grating sound, below, told Briggs the kedging
had begun to show results. A glad sound, indeed,
that grinding of the keel!</p>

<p>“By God, men!” he shouted, turning. “The forefoot’s
comin’ free. Dig in, you swine! Men, when
she clears, we’ll box her off with the fores’l&mdash;we’ll
beat ’em yet!”</p>

<p>Once more allegiance knit itself to Briggs. Despite
that double murder (as surely done by him as if his
own hand had wielded the kris that had beheaded Mr.
Scurlock and the boy), the drums and shoutings of the
war-fleet, added to this new hope of getting clear of
Ulu Salama, fired every white man’s heart with sudden
hope.</p>

<p>The growl that had begun to rise against Briggs
died away.</p>

<p>“Mr. Crevay,” he commanded, striding aft, “livelier
there with those pigs! They’re not doin’ half
a trick o’ work!” Angrily he gestured at the sweat-bathed,
panting men. “You, Lumbard, fetch me up
a fathom o’ rope. <i>I’ll</i> give ’em a taste o’ medicine
that’ll make ’em dig! And you, Mr. Bevans&mdash;how’s
the gun? All loaded with junk?”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir!”</p>

<p>Briggs turned to it. Out over the water he squinted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
laying careful aim at the canoe where Scurlock and
the boy had died.</p>

<p>The canoe had already begun retreating from the
place now marked by a worrying swirl of waters where
the gathering sharks held revel. Back towards the
main fleet it was circling as the paddlemen&mdash;their
naked, brown bodies gleaming with sunlight on the oil
that would make them slippery as eels in case of close
fighting&mdash;bent to their labor.</p>

<p>On the proa and the other sailing-canoes the mat
sails had already been hauled up again. The proa
was slowly lagging forward; and with it the battle-line,
wide-flung.</p>

<p>Briggs once more assured his aim. He seized the
lanyard, stepped back, and with a shout of: “Take
this, you black scum!” jerked the cord.</p>

<p>The rusty old four-inch leaped against its lashings
as it vomited half a bushel of heavy nuts, bolts, brass
and iron junk in a roaring burst of smoke and flame.</p>

<p>Fortune favored. The canoe buckled, jumped half
out of the water, and, broken fair in two, dissolved
in a scattering flurry of débris. Screams echoed
with horrible yells from the on-drawing fleet. Dark,
moving things, the heads of swimmers already doomed
by the fast-gathering sharks, jostled floating things
that but a second before had been living men. The
whole region near the canoe became a white-foaming
thrash of struggle and of death.</p>

<p>“Come on, all o’ you!” howled Briggs with the
laughter of a blood-crazed devil. “We’re ready, you
<i>surkabutchas</i>! Ready for you all!”</p>

<p>With an animal-like scream of rage, a Malay sprang
from the capstan-bar where he had been sweating.
On Crevay he flung himself. A blade, snatched from
the Malay’s breech-clout, flicked high-lights as it
plunged into Crevay’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Whirled by a dozen warning yells, the captain spun.
He caught sight of Crevay, already crumpling down
on the hot deck: saw the reddened blade, the black-toothed
grin of hate, the on-rush of the <i>amok</i> Malay.</p>

<p>Up flung his revolver. But already the leaping
figure was upon him.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">ONSET OF BATTLE</p>

<p>The shot that Wansley fired, a chance shot hardly
aimed at all, must have been guided by the finger of the
captain’s guardian genius. It crumpled the Malay,
with strangely sprawling legs. Kill him it did not.
But the bullet through his lower vertebræ left only
his upper half alive.</p>

<p>With a grunt he crumpled to the hot deck, knife
still clutched in skinny fist. Shouts echoed. Briggs
stood aghast, with even his steel nerve jangling. The
quivering Malay was a half-dead thing that still lived.
He writhed with contorted face, dragging himself toward
Briggs. The knife-blade clicked on the planking,
like the clicking of his teeth that showed black through
slavering lips.</p>

<p>“<i>Allah! il Allah!</i>” he gulped, heaving himself up
on one hand, slashing with the other.</p>

<p>Why do men, in a crisis, so often do stupid, unaccountable
things? Why did Briggs kick at him, with
a roaring oath, instead of shooting? Briggs felt the
bite of steel in his leg. That broke the numbing spell
of unreason. The captain’s pistol, at point-blank
range, shattered the yellow man’s skull. Blood,
smeared with an ooze of brain, colored the stewing
deck.</p>

<p>“<i>Allah! il Al&mdash;!</i>”</p>

<p>The cry ended in a choking gurgle on lips that drew
into a horrible grin. And now completely dead even
beyond the utmost lash of Islamic fanaticism, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Malay dropped face down. This time the captain’s
kick landed only on flesh and bone past any power of
feeling.</p>

<p>At the capstan-bars it was touch-and-go. Crevay
was down, groaning, his hands all slippery and crimson
with the blood that seeped through his clutching fingers.
For a moment, work slacked off. Wansley was shouting,
with revolver leveled, his voice blaring above the
cries, oaths, imprecations. Things came to the ragged
edge of a rush, but white men ran in with rifles and
cutlasses. Briggs flung himself aft, trailing blood.</p>

<p>Crazed with rage and the burn of that wound, he
fired thrice. Malays sagged down, plunged screaming
to the deck. The captain would have emptied his revolver
into the pack, but Wansley snatched him by
the arm.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he shouted. “That’s enough&mdash;we
need ’em, sir!”</p>

<p>Prass, belaying-pin in hand, struck to right, to left.
Yells of pain mingled with the tumult that drowned
the ragged, ineffective spatter of firing from the war-fleet.
The action was swift, decisive. In half a minute,
the capstan was clicking again, faster than ever.
Its labor-power, diminished by the loss of three men,
was more than compensated by the fear of the survivors.</p>

<p>“Overboard with the swine!” shouted Briggs.
“Overboard with ’em, to the sharks!”</p>

<p>“This here one ain’t done for yet, sir,” began
Prass, pointing. “He’s only&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Overboard, I said!” roared Briggs. “You’ll go,
too, by God, if you give me any lip!”</p>

<p>As men laid hands on the Malays to drag them to
the rail, Briggs dropped on his knees beside Crevay.
He pulled away the man’s hands from the gaping
neck-wound, whence the life was irretrievably spurting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Judas priest!” he stammered, for here was his
right-hand man as good as dead. “Doctor! Where
the devil is Mr. Filhiol?”</p>

<p>“In the cabin, sir,” Prass answered.</p>

<p>“Cabin! Holy Lord! On deck with him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And tell him to bring his kit!”</p>

<p>Prass had already dived below. The doctor was
haled up again, with his bag. A kind of hard exultation
blazed in the captain’s face. He seemed not
to hear the shouts of war, the spattering fusillade from
the canoes. His high-arched chest rose and fell, pantingly.
His hands, reddened with the blood of Crevay,
dripped horribly. Filhiol, hustled on deck, stared in
amazement.</p>

<p>“A job for you, sir!” cried Briggs. “Prove yourself!”</p>

<p>Filhiol leaned over Crevay. But he made no move
to open his kit-bag. One look had told him the truth.</p>

<p>The man, already unconscious, had grown waxen.
His breathing had become a stertorous hiccough. The
deck beneath him was terrible to look upon.</p>

<p>“No use, sir,” said the doctor briefly. “He’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Do something!” blazed the captain. “Something!”</p>

<p>“For a dead man?” retorted Filhiol. As he spoke,
even the hiccough ceased.</p>

<p>Briggs stared with eyes of rage. He got to his
feet, hulking, savage, with swaying red fists.</p>

<p>“They’ve killed my best man,” he snarled. “If
we didn’t need the dogs, we’d feed ’em all to the sharks,
so help me!”</p>

<p>“You’re wounded, sir!” the doctor cried, pointing
at the blood-wet slash in the captain’s trouser-leg.</p>

<p>“Oh, to hell with that!” Briggs retorted. “You,
and you,” he added, jabbing a finger at two sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“carry Mr. Crevay down to the cabin&mdash;then back
to your rifles at the rail!”</p>

<p>They obeyed, their burden sagging limply. Already
the dead and wounded Malays had been bundled over
the rail. The fusillade from the war-canoes was
strengthening, and the shouts had risen to a barbaric
chorus. The patter of bullets and slugs into the sea
or against the planking of the <i>Silver Fleece</i> formed a
ragged accompaniment to the whine of missiles through
the air. A few holes opened in the clipper’s canvas.
One of the men who had thrown the Malays overboard
cursed suddenly and grabbed his left elbow,
shattered.</p>

<p>“Take cover!” commanded Briggs. “Down,
everybody, along the rail! Mr. Wansley, down with
you and your men. Get down!”</p>

<p>Indifferent to all peril for himself, Briggs turned
toward the companion.</p>

<p>“Captain,” the doctor began again. “Your boot’s
full of blood. Let me bandage&mdash;”</p>

<p>Briggs flung a snarl at him and strode to the companion.</p>

<p>“Below, there!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” rose the voice of one of the foremast
hands.</p>

<p>“Get that wench up here! The yellow girl! Bring
her up&mdash;an’ look alive!”</p>

<p>“Captain,” the doctor insisted, “I’ve got to do
something for that gash in your leg. Not that I
love you, but you’re the only man that can save us.
Sit down here, sir. You’ll bleed to death where you
stand!”</p>

<p>Something in Filhiol’s tone, something in a certain
giddiness that was already reaching for the captain’s
heart and brain, made him obey. He sat down shakily
on deck beside the after-companion. In the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of all that turmoil, all underlaid by the slow, grinding
scrape of the keel on the sand-bar, the physician performed
his duty.</p>

<p>With scissors, he shore away the cloth. A wicked
slash, five or six inches long, stood redly revealed.</p>

<p>“<i>Tss! Tss!</i>” clucked Filhiol. “Lucky if it’s not
poisoned.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gascar!” shouted the captain. “Go below!”
Briggs jerked a thumb downward at the cabin, whence
sounds of a struggle, mingled with cries and animal-like
snarls, had begun to proceed. “Bring up the jug
o’ rum you’ll find in my locker. Serve it out to all
hands. And, look you, if they need a lift with the girl,
give it; but don’t you kill that wench. I need her,
alive! Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Gascar replied, and vanished down the
companion. He reappeared with a jug and a tin cup.</p>

<p>“They’re handlin’ her all right, sir,” he reported.
“Have a drop, sir?”</p>

<p>“You’re damned shoutin’, I will!” And the captain
reached for the cup. Gascar poured him a stiff
drink. He gulped it and took another. “Now deal
it out. There’ll be plenty more when we’ve sunk the
yellow devils!”</p>

<p>He got to his feet, scorning further care from Filhiol,
and stood there wild and disheveled, with one leg
of his trousers cut off at the knee and with his half-tied
bandages already crimsoning.</p>

<p>“Rum for all hands, men!” he shouted. “And
better than rum&mdash;my best wine, sherry, champagne&mdash;a
bottle a head for you, when this shindy’s over!”</p>

<p>Cheers rose unevenly. Gascar started on his round
with the jug. Even the wounded men, such as could
still raise their voices, shouted approval.</p>

<p>“Hold your fire, men,” the captain ordered. “Let
’em close in&mdash;then blow ’em out o’ the water!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">KUALA PAHANG</p>

<p>The doctor, presently finishing with Briggs, turned
his attention to the other injured ones. At the top
of the companion now stood the captain with wicked
eyes, as up the ladder emerged the two seamen with
the struggling, clawing tiger-cat of a girl.</p>

<p>The cruel beating the captain had given her the
night before had not yet crushed her spirit. Neither
had the sickness of the liquor he had forced her to
drink. Bruised, spent, broken as she was, the spirit
of battle still dwelt in the lithe barbarian. That her
sharp nails had been busy to good effect was proved
by the long, deep gashes on the faces and necks of
both seamen. One had been bitten on the forearm.
For all their strength, they proved hardly more than a
match for her up the narrow, steep companion. Their
blasphemies mingled with the girl’s animal-like cries.
Loudly roared the booming bass of the captain:</p>

<p>“Up with the she-dog! I’ll teach her something&mdash;teach
’em all something, by the Judas priest! Up
with her!”</p>

<p>They dragged her out on deck, up into all that
shouting and firing, that turmoil and labor and blood.
And as they brought her up a plume of smoke jetted
from the bows of the proa. The morning air sparkled
with the fire-flash of that ancient brass cannon. With
a crashing shower of splinters, a section of the rail
burst inward. Men sprawled, howling. But a greater
tragedy&mdash;in the eyes of these sailormen&mdash;befell:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for a billet of wood crashed the jug to bits, cascading
the deck with good Medford. And, his hand paralyzed
and tingling with the shock, Gascar remained
staring at the jug-handle still in his grip and at the
flowing rum on deck.</p>

<p>Howls of bitter rage broke from along the rail,
and the rifles began crackling. The men, cheated of
their drink, were getting out of hand.</p>

<p>“Cease firing, you!” screamed Briggs. “You’ll
fire when I command, and not before. Mr. Bevans!
Loaded again?”</p>

<p>“All loaded, sir. Say when!”</p>

<p>“Not yet! Lay a good aim on the proa. We’ve
got to blow her out o’ the water!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” And Bevans patted the rusty old
piece. “Leave that to me, sir!”</p>

<p>Briggs turned again to the struggling girl. A thin,
evil smile drew at his lips. His face, under its bronze
of tan, burned with infernal exultation.</p>

<p>“Now, my beauty,” he mocked, “now I’ll attend to
you!”</p>

<p>For a moment he eyed Kuala Pahang. Under the
clear, morning light, she looked a strange and wild
creature indeed&mdash;golden-yellow of tint, with tangled
black hair, and the eyes of a trapped tigress. Bruises
wealed her naked arms and shoulders, souvenirs of
the captain’s club and fist. Her supple body was
hardly concealed by her short skirt and by the tight
Malay jacket binding her lithe waist and firm, young
breast.</p>

<p>Briggs exulted over her, helpless and panting in the
clutch of the two foremast-hands. “To the rail with
her!” he ordered.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do, sir?” asked one of the men,
staring. “Heave her over?”</p>

<p>Briggs menaced him with clenched fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“None o’ your damned business!” he shouted.
“To the rail with her! Jump, afore I teach you
how!”</p>

<p>They dragged her, screeching, to the starboard rail.
All the time they had to hold those cat-clawed hands
of hers. From side to side she flung herself, fighting
every foot of the way. Briggs put back his head and
laughed at the rare spectacle. Twice or thrice the
sailors slipped in blood and rum upon the planking,
and once Kuala Pahang all but jerked free from them.
At the capstan, only the pistols of the three white
guards held her kinsmen back from making a stampede
rush; and not even the pistols could silence among
them a menacing hum of rage that seethed and bubbled.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” shouted Briggs. “Mahmud Baba,
you yellow cur, come here!”</p>

<p>Mahmud loosed his hold on the capstan-bar and in
great anguish approached.</p>

<p>“Yas, sar?” whined he. The lean, brown form
was trembling. The face had gone a jaundiced color.
“I come, sar.”</p>

<p>Briggs leveled his revolver at the Malay. Unmindful
of the spattering bullets, he spoke with deliberation.</p>

<p>“Son of a saffron dog,” said he, “you’re going
to tell this wench something for me!”</p>

<p>“Yas, sar. What piecee thing me tell?”</p>

<p>“You tell her that if the boats don’t go back to
land I’ll heave her over the rail. I’ll feed her to the
sharks, by God! Alive, to the sharks&mdash;sharks, down
there! Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Me savvy.”</p>

<p>“And she’s got to shout that to the canoes! She’s
got to shout it to ’em. Go on, now, tell her!”</p>

<p>Mahmud hesitated a moment, shuddered and grimaced.
His eyes narrowed to slits. The captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
poked the revolver into his ribs. Mahmud quivered.
He fell into a sing-song patter of strange words with
whining intonations. Suddenly he ceased.</p>

<p>The girl listened, her gleaming eyes fixed on Mahmud’s
face. A sudden question issued from her
bruised, cut lips.</p>

<p>“What’s she asking?” demanded Briggs.</p>

<p>“She ask where her mother, sar?”</p>

<p>“Tell her! Tell her I’ve shot the old she-devil to
hell, and beyond! Tell her she’ll get worse if she
don’t make the canoes stand off&mdash;worse, because the
sharks will get her alive! Go on, you black scut o’
misery, tell her!”</p>

<p>Mahmud spoke again. He flung a hand at the enveloping
half-circle of the war-fleet. The nearest
boats now were moving hardly a quarter-mile away.
The gleam of krises and of spears twinkled in the
sun. Little smoke-puffs all along the battle-front kept
pace with the popping of gunfire. In the proa, oily
brown devils were laboring to reload the brass cannon.</p>

<p>Mahmud’s speech ended. The girl stiffened, with
clenched hands. The sailors, holding her wrists, could
feel the whipcord tension of her muscles.</p>

<p>“Tell her to shout to the proa there!” yelled the
captain in white fury. “Either they stand off or over
she goes&mdash;and you see for yourself there’s sharks
enough!”</p>

<p>Again Mahmud spoke. The girl grunted a monosyllable.</p>

<p>“What’s that she says?” demanded Briggs.</p>

<p>“She say no, sar. She die, but she no tell her
people.”</p>

<p>“The hell you say!” roared the captain. He seized
her neck in a huge, hairy paw, tightened his fingers
till they bit into the yellow skin, and shook her violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll break your damned, obstinate neck for you!”
he cried, his face distorted. “Tell your people to go
back! Tell ’em!”</p>

<p>Mahmud translated the order. The girl only
laughed. Briggs knew himself beaten. In that sneering
laugh of Kuala Pahang’s echoed a world of maddening
defiance. He loosened his hold, trying to think
how he should master her. Another man grunted,
by the rail, and slid to the deck, where a chance bullet
had given him the long sleep.</p>

<p>Briggs whirled on Mahmud, squeezed his lean
shoulder till the bones bent.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> tell ’em!” he bellowed. “If she won’t, you
will!”</p>

<p>“Me, sar?” whined the Malay, shivering and fear-sick
to the inner marrow. “Me tell so, they kill me!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, <i>I</i> will! Up with you now&mdash;both
o’ you, up, on the rail! Here, you men&mdash;up with
’em!”</p>

<p>They hoisted the girl, still impassive, to the rail, and
held her there. The firing almost immediately died
away. Mahmud tried to grovel at the captain’s feet,
wailing to Allah and the Prophet. Briggs flung him
up, neck and crop. Mahmud grappled the after backstays
and clung there, quivering.</p>

<p>“Go on, now, out with it!” snarled Briggs, his pistol
at the Malay’s back. “And make it loud, or the
sharks will get you, too!”</p>

<p>Mahmud raised a bony arm, howled words that
drifted out over the pearl-hued waters. Silence fell,
along the ragged line of boats. In the bow of the
proa a figure stood up, naked, gleaming with oil in the
sunlight, which flicked a vivid, crimson spot of color
from a nodding feather head-dress.</p>

<p>Back to the <i>Silver Fleece</i> floated a high-pitched question,
fraught with a heavy toll of life and death. Mahmud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
answered. The figure waved a furious arm, and
fire leaped from the brass cannon.</p>

<p>The shot went high, passing harmlessly over the
clipper and ricochetting beyond. But at the same
instant a carefully laid rifle, from a canoe, barked
stridently. Mahmud coughed, crumpled and slid from
the rail. He dropped plumb; and the shoal waters,
clear-green over the bar, received him.</p>

<p>As he fell, Briggs struck the girl with a full drive of
his trip-hammer fist. The blow broke the sailors’ hold.
It called no scream from Kuala Pahang. She fell,
writhing, plunged in foam, rose, and with splendid
energy struck out for the canoes.</p>

<p>Briggs leaned across the rail, as if no war-fleet had
been lying in easy shot; and with hard fingers tugging
at his big, black beard, watched the swimming girl, her
lithe, yellow body gleaming through the water.
Watched, too, the swift cutting of the sharks’ fins
toward her&mdash;the darting, black forms&mdash;the grim
tragedy in that sudden, reddening whip of brine. Then
he laughed, his teeth gleaming like wolves’ teeth, as
he heard her scream.</p>

<p>“Broke her silence at last, eh?” he sneered. “They
got a yell out of the she-dog, the sharks did, even if I
couldn’t&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>Along the rail, hard-bitten as the clipper’s men were,
oaths broke out, and mutterings. Work slackened at
the capstan, and for the moment the guards forgot
to drive their lathering slaves there.</p>

<p>“Great God, captain!” sounded the doctor’s voice,
as he looked up from a wounded man. “You’ve
murdered us all!”</p>

<p>Briggs only laughed again and looked to his pistol.</p>

<p>“They’re coming now, men,” said he coolly. To
his ears the high and rising tumult from the flotilla
made music. The lust of war was in him. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
moment he peered intently at the paddlemen once
more bending to their work; the brandished krises and
long spears; the spattering of bullets all along the
water.</p>

<p>“Let ’em come!” he cried, laughing once more.
“With hot lead and boiling water and cold steel, I
reckon we’re ready for ’em. Steady’s the word, boys!
They’re coming&mdash;give ’em hell!”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">HOME BOUND</p>

<p>Noon witnessed a strange scene in the Straits of
Motomolo, a scene of agony and death.</p>

<p>Over the surface of the strait, inborne by the tide,
extended a broad field of débris, of shattered planks,
bamboos, platted sails.</p>

<p>In mid-scene, sunk on Ulu Salama bar only a few
fathoms from where the <i>Silver Fleece</i> had lain, rested
the dismantled wreck of the proa. The unpitying
sun flooded that wreck&mdash;what was left of it after a
powder-cask, fitted with fuse, had been hurled aboard
by Captain Briggs himself. No living man remained
aboard. On the high stern still projecting from the
sea&mdash;the stern whence a thin waft of smoke still rose
against the sky&mdash;a few broken, yellow bodies lay
half consumed by fire, twisted and hideous.</p>

<p>Of the small canoes, not one remained. Such as
had not been capsized and broken up, had lamely paddled
back to shore with the few Malays who had
survived the guns and cutlasses and brimming kettles
of seething water. Corpses lay awash. The sharks
no longer quarreled for them. Full-fed on the finest
of eating, they hardly snouted at the remnants of the
feast.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the enemy. And the <i>Silver
Fleece</i>&mdash;what of her?</p>

<p>A mile to seaward flying a few rags of canvas, the
wounded clipper was limping on, under a little slant
of wind that gave her hardly steerageway. Her
kedge cable had been chopped, her mizzen-topmast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was down, and a raffle of spars, ropes and canvas littered
her decks or had brought down the awnings, that
smoldered where the fire-arrows had ignited them.</p>

<p>Her deck-houses showed the splintering effects of
rifle and cannon-fire. Here, there, lay empty pails
and coppers that had held boiling water. Along the
rails and lying distorted on deck, dead men and
wounded&mdash;white, brown and yellow&mdash;were sprawling.
And there were wounds and mutilations and
dead men still locked in grapples eloquent of fury&mdash;a
red shambles on the planks once so whitely holystoned.</p>

<p>The litter of knives, krises, cutlasses and firearms
told the story; told that some of the Malays had
boarded the <i>Silver Fleece</i> and that none of these had
got away.</p>

<p>The brassy noonday fervor, blazing from an unclouded
sky, starkly revealed every detail. On the
heavy air a mingled odor of smoke and blood drifted
upward, as from a barbaric pyre to some unpitying and
sanguinary god&mdash;perhaps already to the avenging god
that old Dengan Jouga had called upon to curse the
captain and his ship, “the Eyeless Face that waits
above and laughs.”</p>

<p>A doleful sound of groaning and cursing arose.
Beside the windlass&mdash;deserted now, with part of the
Malays dead and part under hatches&mdash;Gascar was
feebly raising a hand to his bandaged head, as he
lay there on his back. His eyes, open and staring,
seemed to question the sun that cooked his bloodied
face. A brown man, blind and aimless, was crawling
on slippery red hands and knees, amidships; and as he
crawled, he moaned monotonously. Two more, both
white, were sitting with their backs against the deck-house.
Neither spoke. One was past speech; the
other, badly slashed about the shoulders, was groping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in his pockets for tobacco; and, finding none, was feebly
cursing.</p>

<p>Bevans, leaning against the taffrail, was binding his
right forearm with strips torn from the shirt that
hung on him in tatters. He was swearing mechanically,
in a sing-song voice, as the blood seeped through
each fresh turn of cotton.</p>

<p>From the fo’c’s’le was issuing a confused sound.
At the wheel stood a sailor, beside whom knelt the
doctor. As this sailor grimly held the wheel, Filhiol
was bandaging his thigh.</p>

<p>“It’s the best I can do for you now, my man,”
the doctor was saying. “Others need me worse than
you do.”</p>

<p>A laugh from the companionway jangled on this
scene of agony. There stood Alpheus Briggs, smearing
his bearded lips with his hirsute paw&mdash;for once
again he had been at the liquor below. He blinked
about him, set both fists on his hips, and then flung
an oath of all-comprehensive execration at sea and sky
and ship.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, by the holy Jeremiah,” he cried,
with another laugh of barbaric merriment, “I’ve taught
those yellow devils one good lesson!”</p>

<p>A shocking figure the captain made. All at once
Prass came up from below and stood beside him.
Mauled as Prass was, he seemed untouched by comparison
with Briggs. The captain’s presence affronted
heaven and earth, with its gross ugliness of rags and
dirt and wounds, above which his savage spirit seemed
to rise indifferent, as if such trifles as mutilations lay
beneath notice.</p>

<p>Across the captain’s brow a gash oozed redly into
his eye, puffy, discolored. As he smeared his forehead,
his arm knotted into hard bunches. His hairy
breast was slit with slashes, too; his mop of beard had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stiffened from a wound across his cheek. Nothing of
his shirt remained, save a few tatters dangling from
his tightly-drawn belt. His magnificent torso, muscled
like an Atlas, was all grimed with sweat, blood,
dirt. Save for his boots, nothing of his clothing
remained intact; and the boots were sodden red.</p>

<p>Now as he stood there, peering out with his one
serviceable eye under a heavy, bushy brow, and chewing
curses to himself, he looked a man, if one ever
breathed, unbeaten and unbeatable.</p>

<p>The captain’s voice gusted out raw and brutelike,
along the shambles of the deck.</p>

<p>“Hell of a thing, this is! And all along of a yellow
wench. Devil roast all women! An’ devil take the
rotten, cowardly crew! If I’d had that crew I went
black-birding with up the Gold Coast, not one o’ those
hounds would have boarded us. But they didn’t get
the she-dog back, did they? It’s bad, bad, but might
be worse, so help me!”</p>

<p>Again he laughed, with white teeth gleaming in
his reddened beard, and lurched out on deck. He
peered about him. A brown body lay before him,
face upward, with grinning teeth. Briggs recognized
the turtle-egg seller, who had thrown the kris. With
a foul oath he kicked the body.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> got paid off, anyhow,” he growled. “Now
you and Scurlock can fight it out together, in hell!”</p>

<p>He turned to the doctor, and limped along the deck.</p>

<p>“Doctor Filhiol!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” answered the doctor, still busy with
the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Make a short job o’ that, and get to work on
those two by the deck-house. We’ve got to muster
all hands as quick as the Lord’ll let us&mdash;got to get
sail on her, an’ away. These damned Malays will be
worryin’ at our heels again, if we don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Filhiol, curtly. He made the bandage
fast, took his kit, and started forward. Briggs
laid a detaining hand on his arm&mdash;a hand that left a
broad red stain on the rolled-up sleeve.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said he, thickly, “we’ve got to stand together,
now. There’s a scant half-dozen men, here,
able to pull a rope; and with them we’ve got to make
Singapore. Do your best, doctor&mdash;do your best!”</p>

<p>“I will, sir. But that includes cutting off your
rum!”</p>

<p>The captain roared into boisterous laughter and
slapped Filhiol on the back.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to cut my throat first!” he ejaculated.
“No, no; as long as I’ve got a gullet to swallow with,
and the rum lasts, I’ll lay to it. Patch ’em up, doctor,
an’ then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You could do with a bit of patching, yourself.”</p>

<p>The captain waved him away.</p>

<p>“Scratches!” he cried. “Let the sun dry ’em
up!” He shoved the doctor forward, and followed
him, kicking to right and left a ruck of weapons and
débris. Together the men advanced, stumbling over
bodies.</p>

<p>“Patch those fellows up the best you can,” directed
Briggs, gesturing at the pair by the deck-house.
“One of ’em, anyhow, may be some good. We’ve
got to save every man possible, now. Not that I love
’em, God knows,” he added, swaying slightly as he
stood there, with his blood-stained hand upon the rail.
“The yellow-bellied pups! We’ve got to save ’em.
Though if this was Singapore, I’d let ’em rot. At
Singapore, Lascars are plenty, and beach-combers you
can get for a song a dozen. Get to work now, sir, get
to work!”</p>

<p>Life resumed something of order aboard the <i>Silver
Fleece</i>, as she wore slowly down Motomolo Strait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The few Malays of the crew, who had survived the
fight and had failed to make their escape with the retreating
forces, were for the present kept locked in the
deck-house. Briggs was taking no chances with another
of the yellow dogs running <i>amok</i>.</p>

<p>The number of hands who mustered for service,
including Briggs, Wansley and the doctor, was only
nine. This remnant of a crew, as rapidly as weak and
wounded flesh could compass it, spread canvas and
cleaned ship. A grisly task that was, of sliding the
remaining bodies over the rail and of sluicing down
the reddened decks with buckets of warm seawater.
More and more canvas filled&mdash;canvas cut and burned,
yet still holding wind enough to drive the clipper.
The <i>Silver Fleece</i> heeled gracefully and gathered way.</p>

<p>Slowly the scene of battle drew astern, marked by
the thin smoke still rising from the wreckage of the
proa. Slowly the haze-shrouded line of shore grew
dim. A crippled ship, bearing the dregs of a mutilated
crew, she left the vague, blue headland of Columpo
Point to starboard, and so&mdash;sorely broken
but still alive&mdash;passed beyond all danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>And as land faded, Captain Alpheus Briggs, drunk,
blood-stained, swollen with malice and evil triumph,
stood by the shattered taffrail, peering back at the
vanishing scene of one more battle in a life that had
been little save violence and sin. Freighted with
fresh and heavy crimes he exulted, laughing in his
blood-thick beard. The tropic sun beat down upon
his face, bringing each wicked line to strong relief.</p>

<p>“Score one more for me,” he sneered, his hairy
fists clenched hard. “Hell’s got you now, witch-woman,
an’ Scurlock an’ all the rest that went against
me. But I’m still on deck! They don’t stick on <i>me</i>,
curses don’t. And I’ll outlaugh that Eyeless Face&mdash;outlaugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
it, by God, and come again. And so to hell
with that, too!”</p>

<p>He folded steel-muscled arms across his bleeding,
sweating chest, heaved a deep breath and gloried in his
lawless strength.</p>

<p>“To hell with that!” he spat, once more. “I win&mdash;I
always win! To hell with everything that crosses
me!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">AT LONG WHARF</p>

<p>Four months from that red morning, the <i>Silver
Fleece</i> drew in past Nix’s Mate and the low-buttressed
islands in Boston Harbor, and with a tug to ease
her to her berth, made fast at Long Wharf.</p>

<p>All signs of the battle had long since been obliterated,
overlaid by other hardships, violences, evil
deeds. Her bottom fouled by tropic weed and barnacles
that had accumulated in West Indian waters, her
canvas brown and patched, she came to rest. Of all
the white men who had sailed with her, nearly two
years before, now remained only Captain Briggs, Mr.
Wansley, and the doctor. The others who had escaped
the fight had all died or deserted on the home-bound
journey. One had been caught by bubonic at
Bombay, and two by beri-beri at Mowanga, on the
Ivory Coast; the others had taken French leave as
occasion had permitted.</p>

<p>Short-handed, with a rag-tag crew, the <i>Fleece</i>
made her berth. She seemed innocent enough. The
sickening stench of the slave cargo that had burdened
her from Mowanga to Cuba had been fumigated out
of her, and now she appeared only a legitimate trader.
That she bore, deftly hidden in secret places, a hundred
boxes of raw opium, who could have suspected?</p>

<p>As the hawsers were flung and the clipper creaked
against the wharf, there came to an end surely one
of the worst voyages that ever an American clipper-ship
made. And this is saying a great deal. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were hard days&mdash;days when Massachusetts ships
carried full cargoes of Medford rum and Bibles to
the West Coast, and came back as slavers, with black
ivory groaning and dying under hatches&mdash;days when
the sharks trailed all across the Atlantic, for the bodies
of black men and women&mdash;hard days and evil ways,
indeed.</p>

<p>Very spruce and fine was Captain Briggs; very much
content with life and with the strength that in him lay,
that excellent May morning, as with firm stride and
clear eye he walked up State Street, in Boston Town.
The wounds which would have killed a weaker man
had long since healed on him. Up from the water-front
he walked, resplendent in his best blue suit,
and with a gold-braided cap on his crisp hair. His
black beard was carefully trimmed and combed; his
bronzed, full-fleshed face glowed with health and
satisfaction; and the smoke of his cigar drifted behind
him on the morning air. As he went he hummed
an ancient chantey:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Oh, Sharlo Brown, I love your datter,<br />
Awa-a-ay, my rollin’ river!<br />
Oh, Sharlo Brown, I love your datter,<br />
Ah! Ah! We’re bound with awa-a-ay,<br />
’Cross the wide Missouri!”</p>

<p class="p1">Past the ship-chandlers’ stores, where all manner of
sea things lay in the windows, he made his way, and
past the marine brokers’ offices; past the custom-house
and up along the Old State House; and so he came into
Court Street and Court Square, hard by which, in
a narrow, cobbled lane, the Bell-in-Hand Tavern was
awaiting him.</p>

<p>All the way along, shipmasters and seafaring folk
nodded respectfully to Alpheus Briggs, or touched
their hats to him. But few men smiled. His reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of hard blows and harder dealings made men
salute him. But no man seized him by the hand,
or haled him into any public house to toast his safe
return.</p>

<p>Under the dark doorway of the Bell-in-Hand&mdash;under
the crude, wooden fist that from colonial times,
as even to-day, has held the gilded, wooden bell&mdash;Briggs
paused a moment, then entered the inn. His
huge bulk seemed almost to fill the dim, smoky, low-posted
old place, its walls behung with colored woodcuts
of ships and with fine old sporting prints. The
captain raised a hand of greeting to Enoch Winch,
the publican, passed the time of day with him, and
called for a pewter of Four-X, to be served in the
back room.</p>

<p>There he sat down in the half-gloom that seeped
through the little windows of heavily leaded bull’s-eye
glass. He put his cap off, drew deeply at his
cigar, and sighed with vast content.</p>

<p>“Back home again,” he murmured. “A hell of
a time I’ve had, and that’s no lie. But I’m back
home at last!”</p>

<p>His satisfaction was doubled by the arrival of the
pewter of ale. Briggs drank deeply of the cold brew,
then dried his beard with a handkerchief of purple
silk. Not now did he smear his mouth with his hand.
This was a wholly other and more elegant Alpheus
Briggs. Having changed his latitude and raiment, he
had likewise changed his manners.</p>

<p>He drained the pewter till light showed through the
glass bottom&mdash;the bottom reminiscent of old days
when to accept a shilling from a recruiting officer,
even unaware, meant being pressed into the service;
for a shilling in an empty mug was held as proof
of enlistment, unless instantly detected and denied.
Briggs smiled at memory of the trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Clumsy stratagem,” he pondered, “We’re a bit
slicker, to-day. In the old days it took time to make
a fortune. Now, a little boldness turns the trick, just
as I’ve turned it, this time!”</p>

<p>He rapped on the table for another pewter of
Four-X. Stronger liquors would better have suited
his taste, but he had certain business still to be carried
out, and when ashore the captain never let drink take
precedence of business.</p>

<p>The second pewter put Captain Briggs in a reminiscent
mood, wherein memories of the stirring events
of the voyage just ended mingled with the comforting
knowledge that he had much money in pocket and that
still more was bound to come, before that day’s end.
As in a kind of mental mirage, scenes arose before
him&mdash;scenes of hardship and crime, now in security
by no means displeasing to recall.</p>

<p>The affair with the Malay war fleet had already been
half-obliterated by more recent violences. Briggs
pondered on the sudden mutiny that had broken out,
ten days from Bombay, led by a Liverpool ruffian
named Quigley, who had tried to brain him with a
piece of iron in a sock. Briggs had simply flung him
into the sea; then he had faced the others with naked
fists, and they had slunk away forward.</p>

<p>He and Wansley had later lashed them to the gangway
and had given them the cat to exhaustion.
Briggs felt that he had come out of this affair with
honors. He took another draught of ale.</p>

<p>Beating up the West Coast, he recalled how he had
punished a young Irishman, McCune, whom he had
shipped at Cape Town. McCune, from the supposed
security of the foretop-gallant yard, had cursed him
for a black-hearted bucko. Without parley, Briggs
had run up the ratlines, and had flung McCune to the
deck. The man had lived only a few minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Briggs nodded with satisfaction. He clenched his
right fist, hairy, corded, and turned it this way and
that, glad of its power. Greatly did he admire the
resistless argument that lay in all its bones and
ligaments.</p>

<p>“There’s no man can talk back to <i>me</i>!” he growled.
“No, by the Judas priest!”</p>

<p>Now came less pleasing recollections. The slave
cargo on the west-bound voyage had been unusually
heavy. Ironed wrist and ankle, the blacks&mdash;men,
women, children, purchased as a rather poor bargain
lot from an Arab trader&mdash;had lain packed in the
hold. They had been half starved when Briggs had
loaded them, and the fever had already got among
them. The percentage of loss had been a bit too
heavy. Some death was legitimate, of course; but an
excessive mortality meant loss.</p>

<p>The death rate had risen so high that Briggs had
even considered bringing some of the black ivory on
deck, and increasing the ration. But in the end he
had decided to hold through, and trust luck to arrive
in Cuba with enough slaves to pay a good margin.
Results had justified his decision.</p>

<p>“I was right about that, too,” thought he. “Seems
like I’m always right&mdash;or else it’s gilt-edged luck!”</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of all, that voyage had left some disagreeable
memories. The reek and stifle of the hold,
the groaning and crying of the blacks&mdash;that no
amount of punishment could silence&mdash;had vastly annoyed
the captain. The way in which his crew had
stricken the shackles from the dead and from those
manifestly marked for death and had heaved them
overboard to the trailing sharks, had been only a
trivial detail.</p>

<p>But the fact that Briggs’s own cabin had been invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by vermin and by noxious odors had greatly
annoyed the captain. Not all Doctor Filhiol’s burning
of pungent substances in the cabin had been able
to purify the air. Briggs had cursed the fact that
this most profitable trafficking had involved such disagreeable
concomitants, and had consoled himself with
much strong drink.</p>

<p>Then, too, a five-day blow, three hundred miles west
of the Cape Verdes, had killed off more than forty
of his negroes and had made conditions doubly intolerable.
Once more he formulated thoughts in
words:</p>

<p>“Damn it! I might have done better to have
scuttled her, off the African coast, and have drawn
down my share of the insurance money. If I’d known
what I was running into, that’s just what I <i>would</i> have
done, so help me! I made a devilish good thing of
it, that way, in the old <i>White Cloud</i> two years ago.
And never was so much as questioned!”</p>

<p>He pondered a moment, frowning blackly.</p>

<p>“Maybe I did wrong, after all, to bring the <i>Fleece</i>
into port. But if I hadn’t, I’d have had to sacrifice
those hundred boxes of opium, that will bring me a
clear two hundred apiece, from Hendricks. So after
all, it’s all right. I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>He drained the last of the Four-X, and carefully
inspected his watch.</p>

<p>“Ten-fifteen,” said he. “And I’m to meet Hendricks
at ten-thirty at the Tremont House. I’ll hoist
anchor and away.”</p>

<p>He paid his score with scrupulous exactness, for in
such matters he greatly prided himself on his honesty,
lighted a fresh cigar, and departed from the Bell-in-Hand.</p>

<p>Cigar in mouth, smoke trailing on the May morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he made his way to School Street and up it. A
fine figure of a mariner he strode along, erect, deep-chested,
thewed and sinewed like a bull.</p>

<p>In under the columned portals of the old Tremont
House&mdash;now long since only a memory&mdash;he entered,
to his rendezvous with Hendricks, furtive buyer of
the forbidden drug.</p>

<p>And as he vanishes beneath that granite doorway,
for fifty years he passes from our sight.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">AFTER FIFTY YEARS</p>

<p>If you will add into one total all that is sunniest
and most sheltered, all that hangs heaviest with the
perfume of old-fashioned New England gardens, all
that most cozily combines in an old-time sailor’s home,
you will form a picture of Snug Haven, demesne of
Captain Alpheus Briggs, long years retired.</p>

<p>Snug Haven, with gray-shingled walls, with massive
chimney stacks projecting from its weather-beaten,
gambreled roof, seemed to epitomize rest after
labor, peace after strife.</p>

<p>From its broad piazza, with morning-glory-covered
pillars, a splendid view opened of sea and shore and
foam-ringed islets in the harbor of South Endicutt&mdash;a
view commanding kelp-strewn foreshore, rock-buttressed
headlands, sun-spangled cobalt of the bay; and
then the white, far tower of Truxbury Light, and then
the hazed and brooding mystery of open Atlantic.</p>

<p>Behind the cottage rose Croft Hill, sweet with ferns,
with bayberries and wild roses crowding in among
the lichen-crusted boulders and ribbed ledges, where
gnarly, ancient apple-trees and silver birches clung.
Atop the hill, a wall of mossy stones divided the living
from the dead; for there the cemetery lay, its simple
monuments and old, gray headstones of carven slate
bearing some family names that have loomed big in
history.</p>

<p>Along the prim box-hedge of Captain Briggs’s front
garden, the village street extended. Wandering irregularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with the broken shore line, it led past time-grayed
dwellings, past the schoolhouse and the white,
square-steepled church, to the lobstermen’s huts, the
storehouses and wharves, interspersed with “fish-flakes”
that blent pungent marine odors with the fresh
tang of the sea.</p>

<p>Old Mother Nature did her best, all along that street
and in the captain’s garden, to soften those sometimes
insistent odors, with her own perfumes of asters and
petunias, nasturtiums, dahlias, sweet fern, and fresh,
revivifying caresses of poplar, elm and pine, of sumac,
buttonwood and willow.</p>

<p>With certain westerly breezes&mdash;breezes that bore
to Snug Haven the sad, slow chant of the whistling
buoy on Graves Shoal and the tolling of the bell buoy
on the Shallows&mdash;oakum and tar, pitch, salt and fish
had the best of it in South Endicutt. But with a shift
to landward, apple-tree, mignonette and phlox and
other blooms marshalled victorious essences; and the
little village by the lip of the sea grew sweet and warm
as the breast of a young girl who dreams.</p>

<p>The afternoon on which Captain Alpheus Briggs
once more comes to our sight&mdash;the 24th of June, 1918&mdash;was
just one of those drowsy, perfumed afternoons,
when the long roar of the breakers over Dry Shingle
Reef seemed part of the secrets the breeze was whispering
among the pine needles on Croft Hill, and
when the droning of the captain’s bees, among his
spotted tiger-lilies, his sweet peas, cannas and hydrangeas,
seemed conspiring with the sun-drenched warmth
of the old-fashioned garden to lull man’s spirit into
rest and soothe life’s fever with nepenthe.</p>

<p>Basking in the sunlight of his piazza, at ease in a
broad-armed rocker by a wicker table, the old captain
appeared mightily content with life. Beside him lay
a wiry-haired Airedale, seemingly asleep yet with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
eye ready to cock open at the captain’s slightest move.
A blue cap, gold-braided, hung atop one of the uprights
of the rocking-chair; the captain’s bushy hair,
still thick, though now spun silver, contrasted with his
deep-lined face, tanned brown. Glad expectancy
showed in his deep-set eyes, clear blue as they had
been full fifty years ago, eyes under bushy brows that,
once black, now matched the silver of his hair.</p>

<p>White, too, his beard had grown. Once in a while
he stroked it, nervously, with a strong, corded hand
that seemed, as his whole, square-knit body seemed,
almost as vigorous as in the long ago&mdash;the half-forgotten,
wholly repented long ago of violence and
evil ways. Not yet had senility laid its clutch upon
Alpheus Briggs. Wrinkles had come, and a certain
stooping of the powerful shoulders; but the old captain’s
blue coat with its brass buttons still covered a
body of iron strength.</p>

<p>The telescope across his knees was no more trim
than he. Carefully tended beard, well-brushed coat
and polished boots all proclaimed Alpheus Briggs a
proud old man. Though the soul of him had utterly
changed, still Captain Briggs held true to type. In
him no laxity inhered, no falling away from the strict
tenets of shipshape neatness.</p>

<p>The captain appeared to be waiting for something.
Once in a while he raised the telescope and directed
it toward the far blue sheet of the outer harbor, where
the headland of Pigeon Cliff thrust itself against the
gray-green of the ship channel, swimming in a distant
set of haze. Eagerly he explored the prospect, letting
his glass rest on white lines of gulls that covered the
tide-bars, on the whiter lines of foam over the reef, on
the catboats and dories, the rusty coasting steamers
and clumsy coal-barges near or far away. With care
he sought among the tawny sails; and as each schooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tacked, its canvas now sunlit, now umber in shade, the
captain’s gaze seemed questioning: “Are you the
craft I seek?”</p>

<p>The answer came always negative. With patience,
Captain Briggs lowered his glass again and resumed
his vigil.</p>

<p>“No use getting uneasy,” said he, at last; and
brought out pipe and tobacco from the pocket of his
square-cut jacket. “It won’t bring him a bit sooner.
He wrote me he’d be here sometime to-day, and that
means he surely will be. He’s a Briggs. What he
says he’ll do he <i>will</i> do. No Briggs ever breaks a
promise, and Hal is all clear Briggs, from truck to
keelson!”</p>

<p>Waiting, pondering, the old man let his eyes wander
over the Snug Haven of his last years; the place where
he could keep contact with sunshine and seashine, with
the salt breeze and the bite of old ocean, yet where
comfort and peace profound could all be his.</p>

<p>A pleasant domain it was, and in all its arrangements
eloquent of the old captain. There life had
been very kind to him, and there his darkest moments
of bereavement had been fought through, survived.
Thither, more than five-and-forty years ago,
he had brought the young wife whose love had turned
his heart from evil ways and set his feet upon the
better path from which, nearly half a century, they
had not strayed.</p>

<p>In the upper front room his only son, Edward, had
been born; and from the door, close at hand, he had
followed the coffins that had taken away from him the
three beings about whom, successively, the tendrils of
his affection had clung.</p>

<p>First, the hand of death had closed upon his wife;
but, profound as that loss had been, it had left to him
his son. In this same house, that son had grown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
manhood, and had himself taken a wife; and so for
a few years there had been happiness again.</p>

<p>But not for long. The birth of Hal, the old man’s
grandson, had cost the life of Hal’s mother, a
daughter-in-law whom Captain Briggs had loved like
his own flesh and blood; and, two years after, tragedy
had once more entered Snug Haven. Edward Briggs,
on his first voyage as master of a ship&mdash;a granite-schooner,
between Rockport and Boston&mdash;had fallen
victim of a breaking derrick-rope. The granite lintel
that had crushed the body of the old captain’s son
had fallen also upon the captain’s heart. Long after
the grass had grown upon that third grave in the
Briggs burial lot, up there on the hill overlooking the
shining harbor, the old man had lived as in a dream.</p>

<p>Then, gradually, the fingers of little Hal, fumbling
at the latchets of the old man’s heart, had in some
miraculous way of their own that only childish fingers
possess, opened that crushed and broken doorway;
and Hal had entered in, and once more life had smiled
upon the captain.</p>

<p>After even the last leaves of autumn have fallen,
sometimes wonderful days still for a little while warm
the dying world and make men glad. Thus, with the
captain. He had seemed to lose everything; and yet,
after all, Indian summer still had waited for him.
In the declining years, Hal had become his sunshine
and his warmth, once more to expand his soul, once
more to bid him love. And he had loved, completely,
blindly, concentrating upon the boy, the last remaining
hope of his family, an affection so intense that
more than once the child, hurt by the fierce grip of
the old man’s arms, had cried aloud in pain and
fright. Whereat the captain, swiftly penitent, had
kissed and fondled him, sung brave sea chanteys to
him, taught him wondrous miracles of splicing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
weaving, or had fashioned boats and little guns, and so
had brought young Hal to worship him as a child will
when a man comes to his plane and is another, larger
child with him.</p>

<p>Life would have ceased to hold any purpose or
meaning for the captain, had it not been for Hal. The
boy, wonderfully strong, had soon begun to absorb
so much of the captain’s affection that the wounds
in his heart had ceased to bleed, and that his pain
had given place to a kind of dumb acquiescence. And
after the shock of the final loss had somewhat passed
life had taken root again, in Snug Haven.</p>

<p>Hal had thriven mightily in the sea air. Body and
mind, he had developed at a wonderful pace. He had
soon grown so handsome that even his occasional
childish fits of temper&mdash;quite extraordinary fits, of
strange violence, though brief&mdash;had been forgiven by
every one. He had needed but to smile to be absolved.</p>

<p>Life had been, for the boy, all “a wonder and a
wild desire.” The shadow of death had not been able
to darken it. Before very long he had come to care
little for any human relationship save with his grandfather.
But the captain, proud of race, had often
spoken to him of his father and his mother, or, leading
Hal by the hand, had trudged up the well-worn
path to the cemetery on the hill, to show the boy the
well-kept graves.</p>

<p>So Hal had grown up. Shore and sea and sky had
all combined to develop him. School and play, and
all the wonders of cliff, beach, tide, and storm, of
dories, nets, tackle, ships, and sea-things had filled
both mind and body with unusual vigor.</p>

<p>The captain had told Hal endless tales of travel,
had taught him an infinite number of sea-marvels.
Before Hal had reached ten years, he had come to
know every rope and spar of many rigs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>At twelve, he had built a dory; and, two years later
with the captain’s help, a catboat, in which he and
the old man had sailed in all weathers. If there were
any tricks of navigation that the boy did not learn, or
anything about the mysterious doings of the sea, it
was only because the captain himself fell short of
complete knowledge.</p>

<p>In everything the captain had indulged him. Yet
even though he had never inflicted punishment, and
even though young Hal had grown up to have pretty
much his own way, the captain had denied spoiling
him.</p>

<p>“Only poor material will spoil,” he had always
said. “You can’t spoil the genuine, thoroughbred
stuff. No, nor break it, either. I know what I’m
doing. Whose business is it, but my own?”</p>

<p>Sharing a thousand interests in common with Hal,
the captain’s love and hope had burned ever higher
and more steadily. As the violent and grief-stricken
past had faded gradually into a vague melancholy, the
future had seemed beckoning with ever clearer cheer.
The captain had come to have dreams of some day
seeing Hal master of the biggest ship afloat. He
had formed a hundred plans and dreamed a thousand
dreams, all more or less enwoven with the sea. And
though Hal, when he had finished school and had
entered college, had begun to show strange aptitude
for languages&mdash;especially the Oriental tongues&mdash;still
the old man had never quite abandoned hope that
some day the grandson might stand as captain on the
bridge of a tall liner.</p>

<p>For many years another influence had had its part
in molding Hal&mdash;the influence of Ezra Trefethen,
whereof now a word or two. Ezra, good soul, had
lived at Snug Haven ever since Hal’s birth, less as a
servant than as a member of the household. Once he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had cooked for the captain, on a voyage out to Japan.
His simple philosophy and loyalty, as well as his exceeding
skill with saucepans, had greatly attached the
captain to him&mdash;this being, you understand, in the
period after the captain’s marriage had made of him
another and a better man.</p>

<p>When Hal’s mother had died, the captain had given
Ezra dominion over the “galley” at Snug Haven, a
dominion which had gradually extended itself to the
whole house and garden, and even to the upbringing
of the boy.</p>

<p>Together, in a hit-or-miss way that had scandalized
the good wives of South Endicutt, Briggs and Trefethen
had reared little Hal. The captain had given no
heed to hints that he needed a house-keeper or a
second wife. Trefethen had been a powerful helper
with the boy. Deft with the needle, he had sewed
for Hal. He had taught him to keep his little room&mdash;his
little “first mate’s cabin,” as he had always called
it&mdash;very shipshape. And he had taught him sea lore,
too; and at times when the captain had been abroad on
the great waters, had taken complete charge of the
fast-growing lad.</p>

<p>Thus the captain had been ever more and more
warmly drawn towards Ezra. The simple old fellow
had followed the body of the captain’s son up there to
the grave on the hill, and had wept sincerely in the
captain’s sorrow. Together, Briggs and Ezra had
kept the cemetery lot in order. Evenings without
number, after little Hal had been tucked into bed, the
two ageing men had sat and smoked together.</p>

<p>Almost as partners in a wondrous enterprise, they
two had watched Hal grow. Ezra had been just as
proud as the captain himself, when the sturdy, black-haired,
blue-eyed boy had entered high school and
had won his place at football and on the running-track.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
When “Hal” had become “Master Hal,” for
him, on the boy’s entering college, the old servitor
had come to look upon him with something of awe,
for now Hal’s studies had lifted him beyond all possible
understanding. Old Ezra had thrilled with pride
as real and as proprietary as any Captain Briggs had
felt.</p>

<p>Thus, the belovèd idol of the two indulgent old sea-dogs,
Hal had grown up.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">A VISITOR FROM THE LONG AGO</p>

<p>As the captain sat there expectantly on the piazza,
telescope across his knees, dog by his side, a step
sounded in the hallway of Snug Haven, and out issued
Ezra, blinking in the sunshine, screwing up his
leathery, shrewd, humorous face, and from under a
thin palm squinting across the harbor.</p>

<p>“Ain’t sighted him yit, cap’n?” demanded he, in a
cracked voice. “It’s past six bells o’ the aft’noon
watch. You’d oughta be sightin’ him pretty soon,
now, seems like.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” the captain answered. “He
wrote they’d leave Boston this morning early. Seems
as if they should have made Endicutt Harbor by now.”</p>

<p>“Right, cap’n. But don’t you worry none. They
can’t of fell foul o’ nothin’. Master Hall, he’s an A1
man. He’ll make port afore night, cap’n, never you
fear. He’s <i>gotta</i>! Ain’t I got a leg o’ lamb on to
roast, an’ ain’t I made his favorite plum-cake with
butter-an’-sugar sauce? Aye, he’ll tie up at Snug
Haven afore sundown, never you fear!”</p>

<p>The captain only grunted; and old Trefethen, after
careful but fruitless examination of the harbor, went
back into the house again, very much like those figures
on toy barometers that come out in good weather and
retire in bad.</p>

<p>Left alone once more, the captain drew deeply at
his pipe and glanced with satisfaction at his cozy domain.
A pleasant place it was, indeed, and trimly
eloquent of the hand of an old seafaring man. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
precision wherewith the hedge was cut, the whitewashed
spotlessness of the front gate&mdash;a gate on
the “port” post of which was fastened a red ship’s-lantern,
with a green one on the “starboard”&mdash;and
even the sanded walks, edged with conch-shells, all
spelled “shipshape.”</p>

<p>Trailing woodbine covered the fences to right and
left, and along these fences grew thrifty berry bushes.
Apple-trees, whereon green buttons of fruit had already
set, shaded the lawn, interspersed with flower-beds
edged with whitewashed rocks&mdash;flower-beds
bright with hollyhocks, peonies and poppies.</p>

<p>Back of the house a vegetable-garden gave promise
of great increase; and in the hen-yard White Leghorns
and Buff Orpingtons pursued the vocations of
all well-disposed poultry. A Holstein cow, knee-deep
in daisies on the gentle hill-slope behind Snug
Haven, formed part of the household; and last of all
came the bees, denizens of six hives not far from
the elm-shaded well.</p>

<p>But the captain’s special pride centered in the gleaming
white flagpole, planted midway of the front lawn&mdash;a
pole from which flew the Stars and Stripes, together
with a big blue house-flag bearing a huge “B”
of spotless white. This flag and a little cannon of
gleaming brass, from which on every holiday the captain
fired a salute, formed his chief treasures; by
which token you shall read the heart of the old man,
and see that, for all his faring up and down the world,
a certain curious simplicity had at the end developed
itself in him.</p>

<p>Thus that June afternoon, sitting in state amid his
possessions, the captain waited. Waited, dressed in
his very best, for the homecoming of the boy on
whom was concentrated all the affection of a nature
now powerful to love, as in the old and evil days it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had been violent to hate. His face, as he sat there,
was virile, patriarchal, dignified with that calm nobility
of days when old age is “frosty but kindly.”
With placid interest he watched a robin on the
lawn, and listened to the chickadees’ piping monotone
in the huge maple by the gate. Those notes seemed
to blend with the metallic music of hammer and anvil
somewhere down the village street. <i>Tunk-tunk!
Clink-clank-clink!</i> sang the hammer from the shop of
Peter Trumett, as Peter forged new links for the
anchor-chain of the <i>Lucy Bell</i>, now in port for repairs.
Then a voice, greeting the captain from the
rock-nubbled roadway, drew the old man’s gaze.</p>

<p>“How do, cap’n?” called a man from the top of
a slow-moving load of kelp. “I’m goin’ up-along.
Anythin’ I kin do fer you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Jacob,” answered Briggs. “Thank you,
just the same. Oh, Jacob! Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>“Hoa, <i>s-h-h-h-h</i>!” commanded the kelp-gatherer.
“What is it, cap’n?”</p>

<p>The old man arose, placed his telescope carefully
in the rocking-chair, and slowly walked down toward
the gate. The Airedale followed close. The dog’s
rusty-brown muzzle touched the captain’s hand.
Briggs fondled the animal and smiling said:</p>

<p>“I’m not going to leave you, Ruddy. None of us
can go anywhere to-day. Hal’s coming home.
Know that? We mustn’t be away when he comes!”
The captain advanced once more. Half-way down
the walk he paused, picked up a snail that had crawled
out upon the distressful sand. He dropped the snail
into the sheltering grass and went forward again.
At the gate he stopped, leaned his crossed arms on the
clean top-board, and for a moment peered at Jacob
perched on the load of kelp that overflowed the time-worn,
two-wheeled cart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it, cap’n?” Jacob queried. “Somethin’
I kin do fer you?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing you can do for me, but something
you can do for Uncle Everett and for yourself, if you
will.”</p>

<p>At sound of that name the kelp-gatherer stiffened
with sudden resentment.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ fer him, cap’n!” he ejaculated. “He’s
been accommodatin’ as a hog on ice to me, an’ the
case is goin’ through. Nothin’ at all fer that
damned&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait! Hold on, Jacob!” the old man pleaded,
raising his hand. “You can’t gain anything by violence
and hate. I know you think he’s injured you
grievously. He thinks the same of you. In his heart
I know he’s sorry. You and he were friends for
thirty years till this petty little quarrel came up.
Jacob, is the whole boat worth cutting the cables of
good understanding and letting yourselves drift on
the reefs of hate? Is it, now?”</p>

<p>“You been talkin’ with him ’bout me?” demanded
Jacob irefully.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I have said a few words to Uncle
Everett,” admitted the captain. “Uncle’s willing to
go half-way to meet you.”</p>

<p>“He’ll meet me nowheres ’cept in the court-room
down to ’Sconset!” retorted Jacob with heat. “He
done me a smart trick that time. I’ll rimrack <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>“We’ve all done smart tricks one time or another,”
soothed the old captain. The sun through the arching
elms flecked his white hair with moving bits of
light; it narrowed the keen, earnest eyes of blue.
“That’s human. It’s better than human to be sorry
and to make peace with your neighbor. Uncle
Everett’s not a bad man at heart, any more than you
are. Half a dozen words from you would caulk up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the leaking hull of your friendship. You’re not going
to go on hating uncle, are you, when you <i>could</i>
shake hands with him and be friends?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ain’t I, huh?” demanded Jacob. “Why ain’t
I?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re a man and can think!” the captain
smiled. “Harkness and Bill Dodge were bitter
as gall six months ago, and Giles was ready to cut
Burnett’s heart out, but I found they were human,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they ain’t <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Are you less a man than they were?”</p>

<p>“H-m! H-m!” grunted Jacob, floored. “I&mdash;I
reckon not. Why?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got nothing more to say for now,” the captain
answered. “Good-by, Jacob!”</p>

<p>The kelp-gatherer pushed back his straw hat,
scratched his head, spat, and then broke out:</p>

<p>“Mebbe it’d be cheaper, after all, to settle out o’
court rather ’n’ to law uncle. But shakin’ hands, an’
bein’ neighbors with that&mdash;that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good day, Jacob!” the captain repeated. “One
thing at a time. And if you come up-along to-morrow,
lay alongside, and have another gam with
me, will you?”</p>

<p>To this Jacob made no answer, but slapped his reins
on the lean withers of his horse. Creakingly the load
of seaweed moved away, with Jacob atop, rather
dazed. The captain remained there at the gate, peering
after him with a smile, kindly yet shrewd.</p>

<p>“Just like the others,” he murmured. “Can’t make
port all on one tack. Got to watch the wind, and
wear about and make it when you can. But if I know
human nature, a month from to-day Jacob Plummer
will be smoking his pipe down at Uncle Everett’s sail-loft.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of piping voices, beyond the blacksmith-shop,
drew the old captain’s attention thither. He assumed
a certain expectancy. Into the pocket of his
square-cut blue jacket he slid a hand. Along the street
he peered&mdash;the narrow, rambling street sheltered by
great elms through which, here and there, a glint of
sunlit harbor shimmered blue.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. Round the bend by the
smithy two or three children appeared; and after these
came others, with a bright-haired girl of twenty or
thereabout. The children had school-bags or bundles
of books tightly strapped. Keeping pace with the
teacher a little girl on either side held her hands. You
could not fail to see the teacher’s smile, as wholesome,
fresh and winning as that June day itself.</p>

<p>At sight of the captain the boys in the group set
up a joyful shout and some broke into a run.</p>

<p>“Hey, lookit! There’s cap’n!” rose exultant cries.
“There’s Cap’n Briggs!”</p>

<p>Then the little girls came running, too; and all the
children captured him by storm. Excited, the Airedale
set up a clamorous barking.</p>

<p>The riot ended only when the captain had been
despoiled of the peppermints he had provided for
such contingencies. Meanwhile the teacher, as trimly
pretty a figure as you could meet in many a day’s
journeying, was standing by the gate, and with a
little heightened flush of color was casting a look or
two, as of expectancy, up at Snug Haven.</p>

<p>The old captain, smiling, shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Laura,” he whispered. “He’ll be here
before night, though. You’re going to let me keep
him a few minutes, aren’t you, before taking him
away from me?”</p>

<p>She found no answer. Something about the captain’s
smile seemed to disconcert her. A warm flush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
crept from her throat to her thickly coiled, lustrous
hair. Then she passed on, down the shaded street;
and as the captain peered after her, still surrounded
by the children, a little moisture blurred his eyes.</p>

<p>“God has been very good to me in spite of all!” he
murmured. “Very, very good, and ‘the best is yet
to be’!”</p>

<p>He turned and was about to start back toward the
house when the <i>cloppa-cloppa-clop</i> of hoofs along the
street arrested his attention. Coming into view, past
Laura and her group of scholars, an old-fashioned
buggy, drawn by a horse of ripe years, was bearing
down toward Snug Haven.</p>

<p>In the buggy sat an old, old man, wizen and bent.
With an effort he reined in the aged horse. The captain
heard his cracked tones on the still afternoon air:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but can you tell me where Captain
Briggs lives&mdash;Captain Alpheus Briggs?”</p>

<p>A babel of childish voices and the pointing of numerous
fingers obliterated any information Laura
tried to give. The old man, with thanks, clucked to
his horse, and so the buggy came along once more to
the front gate of Snug Haven. There it stopped.</p>

<p>Out of it bent a feeble, shrunken figure, with flaccid
skin on deep-lined face, with blinking eyes behind big
spectacles.</p>

<p>“Is that you, captain?” asked a shaking voice that
pierced to the captain’s heart with a stab of poignant
recollection. “Oh, Captain&mdash;Captain Briggs&mdash;is
that you?”</p>

<p>The captain, turning pale, steadied himself by gripping
at the whitewashed gate. For a moment his staring
eyes met the eyes of the old, withered man in the
buggy. Then, in strange, husky tones he cried:</p>

<p>“God above! It&mdash;it can’t be you, doctor? It
can’t be&mdash;Dr. Filhiol?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO OLD MEN</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it’s Dr. Filhiol!” the little old man made
answer. “I’m Filhiol. And you&mdash;Yes, I’d know
you anywhere. Captain Alpheus Briggs, so help
me!”</p>

<p>He took up a heavy walking-stick, and started to
clamber down out of the buggy. Captain Briggs,
flinging open the gate, reached him just in time to
keep him from collapsing in the road, for the doctor’s
feeble strength was all exhausted with the long journey
he had made to South Endicutt, with the drive from
the station five miles away, and with the nervous shock
of once more seeing a man on whom, in fifty years,
his eyes had never rested.</p>

<p>“Steady, doctor, steady!” the captain admonished
with a stout arm about him. “There, there now,
steady does it!”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you’ll have to excuse me, captain, for
seeming so unmanly weak,” the doctor proffered shakily.
“But I’ve come a long way to see you, and
it’s such a hot day&mdash;and all. My legs are cramped,
too. I’m not what I used to be, captain. None of
us are, you know, when we pass the eightieth milestone!”</p>

<p>“None of us are what we used to be; right for
you, doctor,” the captain answered with deeper meaning
than on the surface of his words appeared. “You
needn’t apologize for being a bit racked in the hull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Every craft’s seams open up a bit at times. I understand.”</p>

<p>He tightened his arm about the shrunken body, and
with compassion looked upon the man who once had
trod his deck so strongly and so well. “Come along
o’ me, now. Up to Snug Haven, doctor. There’s
good rocking-chairs on the piazza and a good little
drop of something to take the kinks out. The best
of timber needs a little caulking now and then. Good
Lord above! Dr. Filhiol again&mdash;after fifty years!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s correct&mdash;after fifty years,” the doctor
answered. “Here, let me look at you a moment!”
He peered at Briggs through his heavy-lensed spectacles.
“It’s you all right, captain. You’ve changed,
of course. You were a bull of a man in those days,
and your hair was black as black;&mdash;but still you’re
the same. I&mdash;well, I wish I could say that about
myself!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” the captain boomed, drawing him toward
the gate. “Wait till you’ve got a little tonic
under your hatches, ’midships. Wait till you’ve
spliced the main brace a couple of times!”</p>

<p>“The horse!” exclaimed Filhiol, bracing himself
with his stout cane. He peered anxiously at the animal.
“I hired him at the station, and if he should
run away and break anything&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll have Ezra go aboard that craft and pilot it
into port,” the captain reassured him. “We won’t let
it go on the rocks. Ezra, he’s my chief cook and
bottle-washer. He can handle that cruiser of yours
O. K.” The captain’s eyes twinkled as he looked
at the dejected animal. “Come along o’ me, doctor.
Up to the quarterdeck with you, now!”</p>

<p>Half-supported by the captain, old Dr. Filhiol
limped up the white-sanded path. As he went, as
if in a kind of daze he kept murmuring:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Briggs again! Who’d have thought I
could really find him? Half a century&mdash;a lifetime&mdash;Captain
Alpheus Briggs!”</p>

<p>“Ezra! Oh, Ezra!” the captain hailed. Carefully
he helped the aged doctor up the steps. Very
feebly the doctor crept up; his cane clumped hollowly
on the boards. Ezra appeared.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir?” he queried, a look of wonder on
his long, thin face. “What’s orders, sir?”</p>

<p>“An old-time friend of mine has come to visit
me, Ezra. It’s Dr. Filhiol, that used to sail with
me, way back in the ’60’s. I’ve got some of his
fancy-work stitches in my leg this minute. A great
man he was with the cutting and stitching; none better.
I want you men to shake hands.”</p>

<p>Ezra advanced, admiration shining from his honest
features. Any man who had been a friend of his
captain, especially a man who had embroidered his
captain’s leg, was already taken to the bosom of his
affections.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said the captain, “this is Ezra Trefethen.
When you get some of the grub from his galley aboard
you, you’ll be ready to ship again for Timbuctoo.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to know you, Ezra,” the doctor
said, putting out his left hand&mdash;the right, gnarled
and veinous, still gripped his cane. “Yes, yes, we
were old-time shipmates, Captain Briggs and I.” His
voice broke pipingly, “turning again toward childish
treble,” so that pity and sorrow pierced the heart of
Alpheus Briggs. “It’s been a sad, long time since
we’ve met. And now, can I get you to look out for
my horse? If he should run away and hurt anybody,
I’m sure that would be very bad.”</p>

<p>“Righto!” Ezra answered, his face assuming an
air of high seriousness as he observed the aged animal
half asleep by the gate, head hanging, spavined knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bent. “I’ll steer him to safe moorin’s fer you, sir.
We got jest the handiest dock in the world fer him,
up the back lane. He won’t git away from <i>me</i>, sir,
never you fear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ezra,” the doctor answered, much relieved.
The captain eased him into a rocker, by the
table. “There, that’s better. You see, captain, I’m a
bit done up. It always tires me to ride on a train;
and then, too, the drive from the station was exhausting.
I’m not used to driving, you know, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” Briggs interrupted. “Just sit
you there, doctor, and keep right still. I’ll be back
in half a twinkling.”</p>

<p>And, satisfied that the doctor was all safe and sound,
he stumped into the house; while Ezra whistled to
the dog and strode away to go aboard the buggy as
navigating officer of that sorry equipage.</p>

<p>Even before Ezra had safely berthed the horse
in the stable up the lane, bordered with sweetbrier and
sumacs, Captain Briggs returned with a tray, whereon
was a bottle of his very best Jamaica, now kept exclusively
for sickness or a cold, or, it might be, for
some rare and special guest. The Jamaica was flanked
with a little jug of water, with glasses, lemons, sugar.
At sight of it the doctor left off brushing his coat, all
powdered with the gray rock-dust of the Massachusetts
north shore, and smiled with sunken lips.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have prescribed better, myself,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Correct, sir,” agreed the captain. He set the
tray on the piazza table. “I don’t hardly ever touch
grog any more. But it’s got its uses, now and then.
You need a stiff drink, doctor, and I’m going to join
you, for old times’ sake. Surely there’s no sin in that,
after half a century that we haven’t laid eyes on one
another!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking, he was at work on the manufacture of a
brace of drinks.</p>

<p>“It’s my rule not to touch it,” he added. “But I’ve
got to make an exception to-day. Sugar, sir?
Lemon? All O. K., then. Well, doctor, here goes.
Here’s to&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To fifty years of life!” the doctor exclaimed. He
stood up, raising the glass that Briggs had given him.
His eye cleared; for a moment his aged hand held
firm.</p>

<p>“To fifty years!” the captain echoed. And so the
glasses clinked, and so they drank that toast, bottoms-up,
those two old men so different in the long
ago, so very different now.</p>

<p>When Filhiol had resumed his seat, the captain
drew a chair up close to him, both facing the sea.
Through the doctor’s spent tissues a little warmth
began to diffuse itself. But still he found nothing to
say; nor, for a minute or two, did the captain. A
little silence, strangely awkward, drew itself between
them, now that the first stimulus of the meeting had
spent itself. Where, indeed, should they begin to knit
up so vast a chasm?</p>

<p>Each man gazed on the other, trying to find some
word that might be fitting, but each muted by the
dead weight of half a century. Filhiol, the more resourceful
of wit, was first to speak.</p>

<p>“Yes, captain, we’ve both changed, though you’ve
held your own better than I have. I’ve had a great
deal of sickness. And I’m an older man than you,
besides. I’ll be eighty-four, sir, if I live till the 16th
of next October. A man’s done for at that age.
And you’ve had every advantage over me in strength
and constitution. I was only an average man, at
best. You were a Hercules, and even to-day you look
as if you might be a pretty formidable antagonist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
In a way, I’ve done better than most, captain. Yes,
I’ve done well in my way,” he repeated. “Still, I’m
not the man you are to-day. That’s plain to be seen.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to talk about that, doctor,” the
captain interposed, his voice soothing, as he laid a
strong hand on the withered one of Filhiol, holding the
arm of the rocker. “Let all that pass. I’m laying
at anchor in a sheltered harbor here. What breeze
bore you news of me? Tell me that, and tell me
what you’ve been doing all this time. What kind
of a voyage have you made of life? And where are
you berthed, and what cargo of this world’s goods
have you got in your lockers?”</p>

<p>“Tell me about yourself, first, captain. You have
a jewel of a place here. What else? Wife, family,
all that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, after you’ve answered my questions,”
the captain insisted. “You’re aboard my craft, here,
sitting on my decks, and so you’ve got to talk first.
Come, come, doctor&mdash;let’s have your log!”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Filhiol began to speak. With some
digressions, yet in the main clearly enough and even
at times with a certain dry humor that distantly recalled
his mental acuity of the long ago, he outlined
his life-story.</p>

<p>Briefly he told of his retirement from the sea, following
a wreck off the coast of Chile, in 1876&mdash;a
wreck in which he had taken damage from which he
had never fully recovered&mdash;and narrated his establishing
himself in practice in New York. Later he
had had to give up the struggle there, and had gone
up into a New Hampshire village, where life, though
poor, had been comparatively easy.</p>

<p>Five years ago he had retired, with a few hundred
dollars of pitiful savings, and had bought his way into
the Physicians’ and Surgeons’ Home, at Salem, Massachusetts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
He had never married; had never known
the love of a wife, nor the kiss of children. His
whole life, the captain could see, had been given unhesitatingly
to the service of his fellow-men. And
now mankind, when old age had paralyzed his skill,
was passing him by, as if he had been no more than
a broken-up wreck on the shores of the sea of human
existence.</p>

<p>Briggs watched the old man with pity that this
once trim and active man should have faded to so
bloodless a shadow of his former self. Close-shaven
the doctor still was, and not without a certain neatness
in his dress, despite its poverty; but his bent
shoulders, his baggy skin, the blinking of his eyes
all told the tragedy of life that fades.</p>

<p>With a pathetic moistening of the eyes, the doctor
spoke of this inevitable decay; and with a heartfelt
wish that death might have laid its summons on him
while still in active service, turned to a few words
of explanation as to how he had come to have news
again of Captain Briggs.</p>

<p>Chance had brought him word of the captain. A
new attendant at the home had mentioned the name
Briggs; and memories had stirred, and questions had
very soon brought out the fact that it was really Captain
Alpheus Briggs, who now was living at South
Endicutt. The attendant had told him something
more&mdash;and here the doctor hesitated, feeling for
words.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Briggs. “You
needn’t be afraid to speak it right out. It’s true,
doctor. I <i>have</i> changed. God knows I’ve suffered
enough, these long years, trying to forget what kind
of a man I started out to be; trying to forget, and
not always able to. If repentance and trying to sail
a straight course now can wipe out that score, maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it’s partly gone. I hope so, anyhow; I’ve done my
best&mdash;no man can do more than that, now, can he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he can,” answered the doctor
slowly.</p>

<p>“He can’t,” said the captain with conviction. “Of
course I can’t give back the lives I took, but so far as
I’ve been able, I’ve made restitution of all the money
I came by wrongfully. What I couldn’t give back
directly I’ve handed over to charity.</p>

<p>“My undoing,” he went on, then paused, irresolute.
“My great misfortune&mdash;was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what?” asked Filhiol. And through his
glasses, which seemed to make his eyes so strangely
big and questioning, he peered at Captain Briggs.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAPTAIN SPEAKS</p>

<p>The captain clenched his right fist, and turned it to
and fro, studying it with rueful attention.</p>

<p>“My undoing was the fact that nature gave me
brute strength,” said he. “Those were hard, bad
days, and I had a hard, bad fist; and together with the
hot blood in me, and the Old Nick, things went pretty
far. Lots of the things I did were needless, cruel,
and beyond all condemnation. If I could only get a
little of the guilt and sorrow off my mind, that would
be something.”</p>

<p>“You’re morbid, captain,” answered Filhiol.
“You’ve made all the amends that anybody can.
Let’s forget the wickedness, now, and try to remember
the better part. You’ve changed, every way. What
changed you?”</p>

<p>“Just let me have another look through the glass,
and I’ll tell you what I can.”</p>

<p>Briggs raised his telescope and with it swept the
harbor.</p>

<p>“H-m!” said he. “Nothing yet.”</p>

<p>“Expecting some one, captain?”</p>

<p>“My grandson, Hal.”</p>

<p>“Grandson! That’s fine! The only one?”</p>

<p>“The only one.” Briggs lowered his glass with
disappointment. “He’s the sole surviving member
of the family, beside myself. All the rest are up
there, doctor, in that little cemetery on the hilltop.”</p>

<p>Filhiol’s eyes followed the captain’s pointing hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as it indicated the burial-ground lying under the vagrant
cloud-shadows of the fading afternoon, peaceful
and “sweet with blade and leaf and blossom.”
In a pine against the richly luminous sky a bluejay
was scolding. As a contrabass to the rhythm of the
blacksmith’s hammer, the booming murmur of the sea
trembled across the summer air. The captain went
on:</p>

<p>“I’ve had great losses, doctor. Bitter and hard
to bear. After I fell in love and changed my way of
life, and married and settled here, I thought maybe
fate would be kind to me, but it wasn’t. One by one
my people were taken away from me&mdash;my wife, and
then my son’s wife, and last of all, my son. Three,
I’ve lost, and got one left. Yet it isn’t exactly as
if I’d really lost them. I’m not one that can bury
love, and forget it. My folks aren’t gone. They’re
still with me, in a way.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how people can let their kin be buried
in strange places and forgotten. I want to keep mine
always near me, where I can look out for them, and
where I know they won’t feel lonesome. I want them
to be right near home, doctor, where it’s all so friendly
and familiar. Maybe that’s an old man’s foolish notion,
but that’s the way I feel, and that’s the way I’ve
had it.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;think I understand,” the doctor answered.
“Go on.”</p>

<p>“They aren’t really gone,” continued Briggs.
“They’re still up there, very, very near to me. There’s
nothing mournful in the lot; nothing sad or melancholy.
No, Ezra and I have made it cheerful, with
roses and petunias and zinnias and all kinds of pretty
flowers and bushes and vines. You can see some of
those vines now on the monument.” He pointed
once more. “That one, off to starboard of the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
elm. It’s a beautiful place, really. The breeze is always
cool up there, doctor, and the sun stays there
longest of any spot round here. It strikes that hill first
thing in the morning, and stays till last thing at night.
We’ve got a bench there, a real comfortable one I
made myself; not one of those hard, iron things they
usually put in cemeteries. I’ve given Hal lots of his
lessons, reading and navigation, up there. I go up
every day a spell, and take the dog with me, and Ezra
goes, too; and we carry up flowers and put ’em in
jars, and holystone the monument and the headstones,
and make it all shipshape. It’s all as bright as a button,
and so it’s going to be, as long as I’m on deck.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ve got the right idea, captain,” murmured
Filhiol. “Death, after all, is quite as natural
a process, quite as much to be desired at the proper
time, as life. I used to fear it, when I was young;
but now I’m old, I’m not at all afraid. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Never! If I can only live to see Hal launched
and off on his life journey, with colors flying and
everything trig aloft and alow, I’ll be right glad to go.
That’s what I’ve often told my wife and the others,
sitting up there in the sunshine, smoking my pipe.
You know, that’s where I go to smoke and think,
doctor. Ezra goes too, and sometimes we take the
old checkerboard and have a game or so. We take
the telescopes and sextant up, too, and make observations
there. It kind of scandalizes some of the stiff-necked
old Puritans, but Lord love you! I don’t see
any harm in it, do you? It all seems nice and sociable;
it makes the death of my people seem only a kind
of temporary going away, as if they’d gone on a visit,
like, and as if Hal and Ezra and I were just waiting
for ’em to come back.</p>

<p>“I tell you, doctor, it’s as homy and comfortable
as anything you ever saw. I’m truly very happy, up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
there. Yes, in spite of everything, I reckon I’m a
happy man. I’ve got no end of things to be thankful
for. I’ve prospered. Best of all, <i>the</i> main thing without
which, of course, everything else wouldn’t be worth
a tinker’s dam, I’ve got my grandson, Hal!”</p>

<p>“I see. Tell me about him, captain.”</p>

<p>“I will. He’s been two years in college already,
and he’s more than made good. He’s twenty-one, and
got shoulders on him like Goliath. You ought to see
him at work in the gym he’s fitted up in the barn!
Oh, doctor, he’s a wonder! His rating is A1, all
through.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it. And you say he’s coming home
to-day?”</p>

<p>“To-day&mdash;which makes this day a great, wonderful
day for his old grandfather, and that’s the living
truth. Yes, he’s coming home for as long as he’ll
stay with me, though he’s got some idea of going out
with the fishing-fleet, for what he calls local color.
He’s quite a fellow to make up stories; says he wants
to go to sea a while, so he can do it right. Though,
Lord knows, he’s full enough of sea-lore and sea-skill.
That’s his grandfather’s blood cropping out
again, I suppose, that love for blue water. That’s
what you call heredity, isn’t it, doctor?”</p>

<p>“H-m! yes, I suppose so,” answered Filhiol, frowning
a little. “Though heredity’s peculiar. We don’t
always know just what it is, or how it acts. Still, if
a well-marked trait comes out in the offspring, we call
it heredity. So he’s got your love of the sea, has he?”</p>

<p>“He surely has. There’s salt in <i>his</i> blood, all right
enough!”</p>

<p>“H-m! You don’t notice any&mdash;any other traits
in him that&mdash;remind you of your earlier days?”</p>

<p>“If you mean strength and activity, and the love
of hard work, yes. Now see, for example. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
other boy would have come home by train, and lots
of ’em would have traveled in the smoker, with a
pack of cigarettes and a magazine. Does Hal come
home that way? He does not! He writes me he’s
going to work his way up on a schooner, out of Boston,
for experience. That’s why I’m keeping my
glass on the harbor. He told me the name of the
schooner. It’s the <i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>. The minute she
sticks her jib round Truxbury Light, I’ll catch her.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sylvia Fletcher?</i>” asked the doctor. “That’s an
odd coincidence, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Why, just look at those initials, captain. <i>Sylvia
Fletcher</i>&mdash;S.F.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about ’em?”</p>

<p>“<i>Silver Fleece.</i> That was S.F., too.”</p>

<p>The captain turned puzzled eyes on his guest. He
passed a hand over his white hair, and pondered a
second or two. Then said he:</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> odd, doctor, but what about it? There
must be hundreds of vessels afloat, with those initials.”</p>

<p>“By all means. Of course it can’t mean anything.
As you say, S.F. must be common enough initials
among ships. So then, Hal’s amphibious already,
is he? What’s he going to be? A captain like yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’d like him to be. I don’t hardly think so,
though,” Briggs answered, a little distraught. Something
had singularly disturbed him. Now and then
he cast an uneasy glance at the withered little man
in the chair beside him.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be his own choice, his profession
is,” he went on. “He’s got to settle that for himself.
But I know this much&mdash;anything he undertakes,
he’ll make a success of. He’ll carry it out to
the last inch. He’s a wonder, Hal is. Ah, a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to warm the heart! He’s none of your mollycoddles,
in spite of all the high marks and prizes he’s taken.
No, no, nothing at all of the molly-coddle.”</p>

<p>The captain’s face lighted up with pride and joy
and a profound eagerness.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything that boy can’t do, doctor,”
he continued. “Athletics and all that; and he’s gone
in for some of the hardest studies, too, and beaten men
that don’t do anything but get round-shouldered over
books. He’s taken work outside the regular course&mdash;strange
Eastern languages, doctor. I hear there
never <i>was</i> a boy like Hal. You don’t wonder I’ve
been sitting here all afternoon with my old spy-glass, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t,” Filhiol answered, a note of envy
in his feeble voice. “You’ve had your troubles, just
as we all have, but you’ve got something still to live
for, and that’s more than <i>I</i> can say. You’ve got
everything, everything! It never worked out on you,
after all, the curse&mdash;the black curse that was put on
you fifty years ago. It was all nonsense, of course,
and I knew it wouldn’t. All that stuff is pure superstition
and humbug&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course! Why, you don’t believe such rubbish!
I’ve lived that all down half a lifetime ago. Two or
three times, when death took away those I loved, I
thought maybe the curse of old Dengan Jouga was
really striking me, but it wasn’t. For that curse said
<i>everything</i> I loved would be taken away, and there
was always something left to live for; and even when
I’d been as hard hit as a man ever was, almost, after
a while I could get my bearings again and make sail
and keep along on my course. Because, you see, I
always had Hal to love and pin my hopes to. I’ve
got him now. He’s all I’ve got&mdash;but, God! how
wonderfully much he is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you’re quite right,” the doctor answered.
“He must be a splendid chap, all round. What does
he look like?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to answer you in a peculiar way,” said
Briggs. “That boy, sir, that grandson of mine, he’s
the living spit and image of what I was, fifty-five or
sixty years ago!”</p>

<p>“Eh, what? What’s that you say?”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, I tell you, to see the resemblance.
His father&mdash;my son&mdash;didn’t show it at all. A fine,
handsome man he was, doctor, and a good man, too.
Everybody liked him; he never did a bad thing in his
life. He sailed a straight course, and went under
his own canvas, all the way; and I loved him for an
honest, upright man. But he wasn’t brilliant. He
never set the world on fire. He was just a plain,
good, average man.</p>

<p>“But, Hal! Hal&mdash;ah, now there <i>is</i> something
for you! He’s got all the physique I ever had, at
my best, and he’s got a hundred per cent. more brains
than ever I had. It’s as if I could see myself, my
youth and strength, rise up out of the grave of the
past, all shining and splendid, doctor, and live again
and make my soul sing with the morning stars, for
gladness, like it says in the Bible or somewhere, sir!”</p>

<p>The old captain, quite breathless with his unaccustomed
eloquence, pulling out a huge handkerchief,
wiped his forehead where the sweat had started. He
winked eyes wet with sudden moisture. Filhiol peered
at him with a strange, brooding expression.</p>

<p>“You say he’s just like you, captain?” asked he.
“He’s just the way you used to be, in the old days?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;no, not in all ways. God forbid! But
in size and strength he’s the equal of me at my best,
or even goes ahead of that. And as I’ve told you
before, he’s got no end more brains than ever I had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’s the boy’s temper?”</p>

<p>“Temper?”</p>

<p>“Ever have any violent spells?” The doctor
seemed as if diagnosing a case. Briggs looked at
him, none too well pleased.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;no. Not as I know of,” he answered,
though without any emphatic denial. “Of course all
boys sometimes slip their anchors, and run foul of
whatever’s in the way. That’s natural for young
blood. I wouldn’t give a brass farthing for a boy
that had no guts, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Of course not. It’s natural for&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Ship ahoy!</i>” the captain joyfully hailed. His
keen old eye had just caught sight of something, far
in the offing, which had brought the glass to his eye
in a second. “There she is, doctor! There’s the
<i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>, sure as guns!”</p>

<p>“He’s coming, then?”</p>

<p>“Almost here! See, right to south’ard o’ the light?
That’s the <i>Sylvia</i>, and my boy’s aboard her. She’ll
be at Hadlock’s Wharf in half an hour. He’s almost
home. Hal’s almost home again!”</p>

<p>The captain stood up and faced the doctor, radiant.
Joy, pride, anticipation beamed from his weather-beaten
old face; his eyes sparkled, blue, with pure
happiness. He said:</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going down to meet him. Do you
want to go, too, doctor?”</p>

<p>“How far is it?”</p>

<p>“Mile, or a little better. I’ll make it, easy, afore
the <i>Sylvia</i> gets in. I’ll be on the wharf, all right,
to welcome Hal.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think I’ll stay here, captain,” the other
answered. “I’m lame, you know. I couldn’t walk
that far.”</p>

<p>“How about the horse? Ezra’ll hitch up for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no. It tires me to ride. I’m not used to so
much excitement and activity. If it’s all the same
to you, I’ll just sit here and wait. Give me a book,
or something, and I’ll wait for you both.”</p>

<p>“All right, doctor, suit yourself,” the captain assented.
The relief in his voice was not to be concealed.
Despite his most friendly hospitality, something
in the doctor’s attitude and speech had laid a
chill upon his heart. The prospect of getting away
from the old man and of meeting Hal quite alone,
allured him. “I’ll give you books enough for a week,
or anything you like. And here in this drawer,” as he
opened one in the table, “you’ll find a box of the best
Havanas.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ve given up smoking, long ago,” the
doctor smiled, thinly. “My heart wouldn’t stand it.
But thank you, just the same.”</p>

<p>The figure of Ezra loomed in the doorway, and,
followed by the dog, came out upon the porch.</p>

<p>“Sighted him, cap’n?” asked the old man joyfully.
“I heered you hailin’. That’s him, sure?”</p>

<p>“There’s the <i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>,” Briggs made answer.
“You’ll see Hal afore sundown.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, ain’t that great, though?” grinned Ezra,
his leathery face breaking into a thousand wrinkles.
“If I’d of went an’ made that there cake, an’ fixed
that lamb, an’ he hadn’t of made port&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right, Ezra. Now I’m off. Come,
Ruddy,” he summoned the Airedale. “Master’s coming!”</p>

<p>As the dog got up, the doctor painfully rose from
his chair. Cane in hand, he limped along the porch.</p>

<p>“It’s just a trifle chilly out here, captain,” said he,
shivering slightly. “May I go inside?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask, doctor. Snug Haven’s yours, all yours,
as long as you want it. Make yourself at home!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Books, papers, everything in the library&mdash;my cabin,
I call it. And if you want, Ezra’ll start a fire for
you in the grate, and get you tea or coffee&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, thank you. My nerves won’t stand them.
But a little warm milk and a fire will do me a world
of good.”</p>

<p>“Ezra’ll mix you an egg-nog that will make you
feel like a fighting-cock. Now I must be going. Hal
mustn’t come ashore and not find me waiting. Come,
Ruddy! Good-by, doctor. Good-by, Ezra; so long!”</p>

<p>“Tell Master Hal about the plum-cake an’ the
lamb!” called the faithful one, as Captain Briggs, a
brave and sturdy figure in his brass-buttoned coat of
blue and his gold-laced cap tramped down the sandy
walk. “Don’t fergit to tell him I got it special!”</p>

<p>At the gate, Briggs waved a cheery hand. The
doctor, peering after him with strange, sad eyes, shook
a boding head. He stood leaning on his stick, till
Briggs had skirted the box-hedge and disappeared
around the turn by the smithy. Then, shivering again&mdash;despite
the brooding warmth of the June afternoon&mdash;he
turned and followed Ezra into the house.</p>

<p>“After fifty years,” he murmured, as he went. “I
wonder if it could be&mdash;after fifty years?”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">VISIONS OF THE PAST</p>

<p>Comfortably installed in a huge easy-chair beside
the freshly built fire in the “cabin” of Snug Haven
and with one of Ezra Trefethen’s most artful egg-nogs
within easy reach, the aged doctor leaned back, and
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Maybe the captain’s right,” said he. “Maybe the
boy’s all right. It’s possible; but I don’t know, I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>Blinking, his eyes wandered about the room, which
opened off from an old-fashioned hallway lighted by
glass panels at the sides of the front door, and by a
leaded fanlight over the lintel; a hallway with a curved
stairway that would have delighted the heart of any
antiquarian. The cabin itself showed by its construction
and furnishing that the captain had spent a great
deal of thought and time and money. At first glance,
save that the fireplace was an incongruous note, one
would have thought one’s self aboard ship, so closely
had the nautical idea been carried out.</p>

<p>To begin with, the windows at the side, which opened
out upon the orchard, were circular and rimmed with
shining brass, and had thick panes inward-swinging
like ships’ portholes. A polished fir column, set a
trifle on a slant, rose from floor to ceiling, which
was supported on white beams, the form and curve of
which exactly imitated marine architecture. This
column measured no less than a foot and a half in
diameter, and gave precisely the impression of a ship’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mast. On it hung a chronometer, boxed in a case of
polished mahogany, itself the work of the captain’s
own hand.</p>

<p>All the lamps were hung in gimbals, as if the good
captain expected Snug Haven at any moment to set
sail and go pitching away over storm-tossed seas.
The green-covered table bore a miscellany of nautical
almanacs; it accommodated, also, a variety of charts,
maps and meteorological reports. The captain’s own
chair at that table was a true swinging-chair, screwed
to the floor; and this floor, you understand, was uncarpeted,
so that the holystoned planking shone in
immaculate cleanliness as the declining sun through
the portholes painted long, reddish stripes across it.
Brass instruments lay on the table, and from them
the sun flecked little high-lights against the clean, white
paint of the cabin.</p>

<p>At the left of the table stood a binnacle, with compass
and all; at the right, a four-foot globe, its surface
scored with numerous names, dates and memoranda,
carefully written in red ink. The captain’s log-book,
open on the table, also showed writing in red. No
ordinary diary sufficed for Alpheus Briggs; no, he
would have a regulation ship’s log to keep the record
of his daily life, or he would have no record at all.</p>

<p>In a rack at one side rested two bright telescopes,
with an empty place for the glass now out on the
piazza. Beneath this rack a sextant hung; and at one
side the daily government weather-report was affixed
to a white-painted board.</p>

<p>A sofa-locker, quite like a ship’s berth, still showed
the impress of the captain’s body, where he had taken
his after-dinner nap. One almost thought to hear the
chanting of sea-winds in cordage, aloft, and the creak
and give of seasoned timbers. A curious, a wonderful
room, indeed! And as Dr. Filhiol studied it, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
expressed a kind of yearning eagerness; for to his
fading life this connotation of the other, braver days
brought back memories of things that once had been,
that now could never be again.</p>

<p>Yet, analyzing everything, he put away these
thoughts. Many sad years had broken the spirit in
him and turned his thoughts to the worse aspects of
everything. He shook his head again dubiously, and
his thin lips formed the words:</p>

<p>“This is very, very strange. This is some form
of mental aberration, surely. No man wholly sane
would build and furnish any such grotesque place.
It’s worse, worse than I thought.”</p>

<p>Contemplatively he sipped the egg-nog and continued
his observations, while from the kitchen&mdash;no, the
galley&mdash;sounded a clink of coppers, mingled with
the piping song of old Ezra, interminably discoursing
on the life and adventures of the unfortunate Reuben
Ranzo, whose chantey is beknown to all seafaring men.
The doctor’s eyes, wandering to the wall nearest him,
now perceived a glass-fronted cabinet, filled with a
most extraordinary <i>omnium gatherum</i> of curios.</p>

<p>Corals, sponges, coir, nuts, pebbles and dried fruits,
strange puffy and spiny fishes, specimens in alcohol,
a thousand and one oddments jostled each other on
the shelves.</p>

<p>Nor was this all to excite the doctor’s wonder.
For hard by the cabinet he now perceived the door of
a safe, set into the wall, its combination flush with
the white boards.</p>

<p>“The captain can’t be so foolish as to keep his money
in his house,” thought Filhiol. “Not when there are
banks that offer absolute security. But then, with a
man like Captain Briggs, anything seems possible.”</p>

<p>He drank a little more of Ezra’s excellent concoction,
and turned his attention to the one remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
side of the cabin, almost filled by the huge-throated
fireplace and by the cobbled chimney.</p>

<p>“More junk!” said Dr. Filhiol unsympathetically.</p>

<p>Against the cobble-stones, suspended from hooks
screwed into the cement, hung a regular arsenal of
weapons: yataghans, scimitars, sabers and muskets&mdash;two
of them rare Arabian specimens with long barrels
and silver-chased stocks. Pistols there were, some of
antique patterns bespeaking capture or purchase from
half-civilized peoples. Daggers and stilettos had been
worked into a kind of rough pattern. A bow and
arrows, a “Penang lawyer,” and a couple of boomerangs
were interspersed between some knobkerries
from Australia, and a few shovel-headed spears and
African pigmies’ blow-guns. All the weapons showed
signs of wear or rust. In every probability, all had
taken human life.</p>

<p>Odd, was it not, that the captain, now so mild a
man of peace, should have maintained so grim a reliquary?
But, perhaps (the doctor thought), Briggs had
preserved it as a kind of strange, contrasting reminder
of his other days, just as more than one reformed
drunkard has been known to keep the favorite little
brown jug that formerly was his undoing.</p>

<p>Filhiol, however, very deeply disapproved of this
collection. Old age and infirmity had by no means
rendered his disposition more suave. He muttered
words of condemnation, drank off a little more of the
egg-nog, and once again fell to studying the collection.
And suddenly his attention concentrated, fixing itself
with particular intentness on a certain blade that until
then had escaped his scrutiny.</p>

<p>This blade, a Malay kris with a beautifully carved
lotus-bud on the handle, seemed to occupy a sort of
central post of honor, toward which the other knives
converged. The doctor adjusted his spectacles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
studied it for a long minute, as if trying to bring back
some recollections not quite clear. Then he arose
lamely, and squinted up at the blade.</p>

<p>“That’s a kris,” said he slowly. “A Malay kris.
Good Lord, it couldn’t be&mdash;<i>the</i> kris, could it?”</p>

<p>He remained a little while, observing the weapon.
The sunlight, ever growing redder as the sun sank over
Croft Hill and the ancient cemetery, flicked lights from
the brass instruments on the table, and for a moment
seemed to crimson the vicious, wavy blade of steel.
The doctor raised a lean hand to touch the kris, then
drew back.</p>

<p>“Better not,” said he. “That’s the one, all right
enough. There’s the groove, the poison groove.
There couldn’t be two exactly alike. I remember
that groove especially. And curaré lasts for years;
it’s just as fatal now, as when it was first put on. That
kris is mighty good to let alone!”</p>

<p>A dark, rusty stain on the blade set him shuddering.
Blood, was it&mdash;blood, from the long ago? Who
could say? The kris evoked powerful memories. The
battle of Motomolo Strait rose up before him. The
smoke from the fire in the grate seemed, all at once,
that of the burning proa, drifting over the opalescent
waters of that distant sea. The illusion was extraordinary.
Dr. Filhiol closed his eyes, held tightly to the
edge of the mantel, and with dilated nostrils sniffed
the smoke. He remained there, transfixed with poignant
emotions, trembling, afraid.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if the shadowy hand of some
malignant <i>jinnee</i> had reached out of the bleeding past,
and had laid hold on him&mdash;a hand that seized and
shook his heart with an envenomed, bony clutch.</p>

<p>“God!” he murmured. “What a time that was&mdash;what
a ghastly, terrible time!”</p>

<p>He tried to shake off this obsessing vision, opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
his eyes, and sank down into the easy-chair. Unnerved,
shaking, he struck the glass still holding some
of the egg-nog, and knocked it to the floor.</p>

<p>The crash of the breaking glass startled him as if
it had been the crack of a rifle. Quivering, he stared
down at the liquor, spreading over the holystoned floor.
Upon it the red sunlight gleamed; and in a flash he
beheld once more the deck of the old <i>Silver Fleece</i>,
smeared and spotted with blood.</p>

<p>Back he shrank, with extended hands, superstitious
fear at his heart. Something nameless, cold and terrible
fingered at the latchets of his soul. It was all
irrational enough, foolish enough; but still it caught
him in its grip, that perfectly unreasoning, heart-clutching
fear.</p>

<p>Weakly he pressed a shaking hand over his eyes.
With bloodless lips he quavered:</p>

<p>“After fifty years, my God! After fifty years!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LOOMING SHADOW</p>

<p>Old Captain Briggs, meanwhile, absorbed in the
most cheerful speculations, was putting his best foot
forward on the road to Hadlock’s Wharf. A vigorous
foot it was, indeed, and right speedily it carried him.
With pipe in full eruption, leaving a trail of blue smoke
on the late afternoon air, and with boots creaking on
the hard, white road, the captain strode along; while
the Airedale trotted ahead as if he, too, understood that
Master Hal was coming home.</p>

<p>He made his way out of the village and so struck
into the road to Endicutt itself. “The mingled scents
of field and ocean” perfumed the air, borne on a breeze
that blent the odors of sea and weedy foreshore and
salt marsh with those of garden and orchard, into a
kind of airy nectar that seemed to infuse fresh life into
the captain’s blood. His blue eyes sparkled almost as
brightly as the harbor itself, where gaily painted lobster-pot
buoys heaved on the swells, where dories labored
and where gulls spiraled.</p>

<p>Briggs seemed to love the sea, that afternoon, almost
as he had never loved it&mdash;the wonderful mystery of
tireless, revivifying, all-engendering sea. Joy filled
him that Hal, in whose life lived all the hopes of his
race, should have inherited this love of the all-mother,
Ocean.</p>

<p>Deeply the captain breathed, as he strode onward,
and felt that life was being very good to him. For
the most part, rough hillocks and tangled clumps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
pine, hemlock and gleaming birch hid the bay from
him; but now and again these gave way to sandy
stretches, leaving the harbor broad-spread and sparkling
to his gaze. And as the old man passed each such
place, his eyes sought the incoming canvas of the <i>Sylvia
Fletcher</i>, that seemed to him shining more white, uprearing
itself with more stately power, than that of
any other craft.</p>

<p>Now and then he hailed the boy as if Hal could hear
him across all that watery distance. His hearty old
voice lost itself in the ebbing, flowing murmur of the
surf that creamed up along the pebbles, and dragged
them down with a long, rattling slither. Everything
seemed glad, to Captain Briggs&mdash;dories hauled up
on the sand; blocks, ropes and drying sails; lobster-pots
and fish-cars; buoys, rusty anchors half-buried&mdash;everything
seemed to wear a festive air. For was not
Hal, now homeward bound, now almost here?</p>

<p>So overflowing were the old man’s spirits that with
good cheer even beyond his usual hearty greeting he
gave the glad news to all along the road, to those he
met, to those who stopped their labors or looked up
from their rest in yards and houses, to give him a good-evening.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a good evening for me, neighbor,” he would
say, with a fine smile, his beard snowy in the sun now
low across the western hills. “A fine, wonderful
evening! Hal’s coming home to-night; he’s on the
<i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>, just making in past the Rips, there&mdash;see,
you can sight her, yourself.”</p>

<p>And then he would pass on, glad, triumphant. And
as he went, hammers would cease their caulking,
brushes their painting; and the fishers mending their
russet nets spread over hedge or fence would wish him
joy.</p>

<p>Here, there, a child would take his hand and walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with him a little way, till the captain’s stout pace tired
the short legs, or till some good mother from a cottage
door would call the little one back for supper. Just
so, fifty years ago, yellow-skinned Malay mothers had
called their children within doors, at Batu Kawan, lest
Mambang Kuning, the demon who dwelt in the sunset,
should do them harm. And just so the sunset itself,
that wicked night at the Malay <i>kampong</i>, had
glowered redly.</p>

<p>A mist was now rising from the harbor and the
marshland, like an exhalation of pale ghosts, floating
vaguely, quite as the smoke had floated above Batu
Kawan. The slowly fading opalescence of the sky,
reddening over the hills, bore great resemblance to
those hues that in the long ago had painted the sky
above the jagged mountain-chain in that far land.
But of all this the captain was taking no thought.</p>

<p>No, nothing could enter his mind save the glad
present and the impending moment when he should see
his Hal again, should feel the boy’s hand in his, put an
arm about his shoulder and, quite unashamed, give him
a kiss patriarchal in its fine simplicity and love.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a good evening!” he repeated. “A wonderful
evening, friends. Why, Hal’s been gone nearly six
months. Gone since last Christmas. And now he’s
coming back to me, again!”</p>

<p>So he passed on. One thing he did not note: this&mdash;that
though all the folk gave him Godspeed, no one inquired
about Hal. That after he had passed, more
than one shook a dubious head or murmured words of
commiseration. Some few of the fisherfolk, leaning
over their fences to watch after him, talked a little
together in low tones as if they feared the breeze might
bear their words to the old man.</p>

<p>Of all this the captain remained entirely unaware.
On he kept, into the straggling outskirts of Endicutt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Now he could see the harbor only at rare intervals; but
in the occasional glimpses he caught of it, he saw the
<i>Sylvia Fletcher’s</i> tops’ls crumpling down and perceived
that she was headed in directly for the wharf. He
hurried on, at a better pace. Above all things Hal
must not come, and find no grandfather waiting for
him. That, to the captain’s mind, would have been unthinkable
treason.</p>

<p>The captain strode along the cobblestoned main
street, past the ship-chandlers’ stores, the sail-lofts
and quaint old shops, and so presently turned to the
right, into Hadlock’s Wharf. Here the going was
bad, because of crates and barrels of iced fish and
lobsters, and trucks, and a miscellany of obstructions.
For a moment the captain was entirely blocked by a
dray across the wharf, backing into a fish-shed. The
driver greeted him with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hello, cap!” cried he. “Gee, but you’re lookin’
fine. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“It’s a great day for me,” Briggs answered. “A
rare fine day. Hal, my boy, is coming home. He’s
on the <i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>, just coming in from Boston.
Can’t you let me past, some way?”</p>

<p>“Why, sure! Back <i>up</i>!” the driver commanded,
savagely jerking at the bit. “You can make it, now, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>Then, as Briggs squeezed by, he stood looking after
the old, blue-clad figure. He turned a lump in his
cheek, and spat.</p>

<p>“Gosh, ain’t it a shame?” he murmured. “Ain’t
it a rotten, gorrammed shame?”</p>

<p>By the time Captain Briggs, followed by the faithful
Ruddy, reached the stringpiece of the wharf, the
schooner was already close. The captain, breathing a
little fast, leaned against a tin-topped mooring-pile,
and with eager eyes scrutinized the on-coming vessel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
All along the wharf, the usual contingent of sailors,
longshoremen, fishers and boys had already gathered.
To none the captain addressed a word. All his heart
and soul were now fast riveted to the schooner, from
whose deck plainly drifted words of command, and
down from whose sticks the canvas was fast collapsing.</p>

<p>With skilful handling and hardly a rag aloft, she
eased alongside. Ropes came sprangling to the wharf.
These, dragged in by volunteer hands, brought
hawsers. And with a straining of hemp, the <i>Sylvia</i>
hauled to a dead stop, groaning and chafing against the
splintered timbers.</p>

<p>Jests, greetings, laughter volleyed between craft and
wharf. The captain, alone, kept silent. His eager
eyes were searching the deck; searching, and finding
not.</p>

<p>“Hello, cap’n! Hey, there, Cap’n Briggs!” voices
shouted. The mate waved a hand at him, and so did
two or three others; but there seemed restraint in their
greetings. Usually the presence of the captain
loosened tongues and set the sailormen glad. But
now&mdash;</p>

<p>With a certain tightening round the heart, the captain
remained there, not knowing what to do. He
had expected to see Hal on deck, waving a cap at him,
shouting to him. But Hal remained invisible. What
could have happened? The captain’s eyes scrutinized
the deck, in vain. Neither fore nor aft was Hal.</p>

<p>Briggs stepped on the low rail of the schooner and
went aboard. He walked aft, to the man at the wheel.
Ruddy followed close at heel.</p>

<p>“Hello, cap’n,” greeted the steersman. “Nice day,
ain’t it?” His voice betrayed embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Is my boy, Hal, aboard o’ you?” demanded
Briggs.</p>

<p>“Yup.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, where is he?”</p>

<p>“Below.”</p>

<p>“Getting his dunnage?”</p>

<p>“Guess so.” The steersman sucked at his cob pipe,
very ill at ease. Briggs stared at him a moment, then
turned toward the companion.</p>

<p>A man’s head and shoulders appeared up the companionway.
Out on deck clambered the man&mdash;a
young man, black-haired and blue-eyed, with mighty
shoulders and a splendidly corded neck visible in the
low roll of his opened shirt. His sleeves, rolled up,
showed arms and fists of Hercules.</p>

<p>“<i>Hal!</i>” cried the captain, a world of gladness in his
voice. Silence fell, all about; every one stopped talking,
ceased from all activities; all eyes centered on Hal
and the captain.</p>

<p>“Hal! My boy!” exclaimed Briggs once more, but
in an altered tone. He took a step or two forward.
His hand, that had gone out to Hal, dropped at his
side again.</p>

<p>He peered at his grandson with troubled, wondering
eyes. Under the weathered tan of his face, quick
pallor became visible.</p>

<p>“Why, Hal,” he stammered. “What&mdash;what’s
happened? What’s the meaning of&mdash;of all this?”</p>

<p>Hal stared at him with an expression the old man had
never seen upon his face. The boy’s eyes were reddened,
bloodshot, savage with unreasoning passion.
The right eye showed a bruise that had already begun
to discolor. The jaw had gone forward, become prognathous
like an ape’s, menacing, with a glint of strong,
white teeth. The crisp black hair, rumpled and awry,
the black growth of beard&mdash;two days old, strong on
that square-jawed face&mdash;and something in the full-throated
poise of the head, brought back to the old
captain, in a flash, vivid and horrible memories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Up from that hatchway he saw himself arising, once
again, tangibly and in the living flesh. In the swing
of Hal’s huge fists, the squaring of his shoulders, his
brute expression of blood-lust and battle-lust, old Captain
Briggs beheld, line for line, his other and barbaric
self of fifty years ago.</p>

<p>“Good God, Hal! What’s <i>this</i> mean?” he gulped,
while along the wharf and on deck a staring silence
held. But his question was lost in a hoarse shout
from the cabin:</p>

<p>“Here, you young devil! Come below, an’ apologize
fer that!”</p>

<p>Hal swung about, gripped both sides of the companion,
and leaned down. The veins in his powerful
neck, taut-swollen, seemed to start through the bronzed
skin.</p>

<p>“Apologize?” he roared down the companion.
“To a lantern-jawed P. I. like you? Like hell I will!”</p>

<p>Then he stood back, lifted his head and laughed with
deep-lunged scorn.</p>

<p>From below sounded a wordless roar. Up the ladder
scrambled, simian in agility, a tall and wiry man of
middle age. Briggs saw in a daze that this man was
white with passion; he had that peculiar, pinched look
about the nostrils which denotes the killing rage. Captain
Fergus McLaughlin, of Prince Edward’s Island,
had come on deck.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;&mdash;!” McLaughlin hurled at him, while the
old man stood quivering, paralyzed. “If you was a
member o’ my crew, damn y’r lip&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m not, you see,” sneered Hal, fists on
hips. “I’m a passenger aboard your rotten old tub,
which is almost as bad as your grammar and your
reputation.” Contemptuously he eyed the Prince Edward’s
Islander, from rough woolen cap to sea-boots,
and back again, every look a blistering insult. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
huge chest, rising, falling, betrayed the cumulating
fires within. The hush among the onlookers grew
ominous. “There’s not money enough in circulation
to hire me to sign articles with a low-browed, sockless,
bean-eating&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLaughlin’s leap cut short the sentence. With a
raw howl, the P. I. flung himself at Hal. Deft and
strong with his stony-hard fists was McLaughlin, and
the fighting heart in him was a lion’s. A hundred men
had he felled to his decks, ere now, and not one had
ever risen quite whole, or unassisted. In the extremity
of his rage he laughed as he sprang.</p>

<p>Lithely, easily, with the joy and love of battle in his
reddened eyes, Hal ducked. Up flashed his right fist,
a sledge of muscle, bone, sinew. The left swung free.</p>

<p>The impact of Hal’s smash thudded sickeningly, with
a suggestion of crushed flesh and shattered bone.</p>

<p>Sprawling headlong, hands clutching air, McLaughlin
fell. And, as he plunged with a crash to the planking,
Hal’s laugh snarled through the tense air. From
him he flung old Briggs, now in vain striving to clutch
and hold his arm.</p>

<p>“Got enough apology, you slab-sided herring-choker?”
he roared, exultant. “Enough, or want
some more? Apologize? You bet&mdash;with these!
Come on, you or any of your crew, or all together, you
greasy fishbacks! <i>I’ll</i> apologize you!”</p>

<p>Snarling into a laugh he stood there, teeth set, neck
swollen and eyes engorged with blood, his terrible fists
eager with the lust of war.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">HAL SHOWS HIS TEETH</p>

<p>Fergus McLaughlin, though down, had not yet taken
the count. True, Hal had felled him to his own deck,
half-stunned; but the wiry Scot, toughened by many
seas, had never yet learned to spell “defeat.” For
him, the battle was just beginning. He managed to
rise on hands and knees. Mouthing curses, he swayed
there. Hal lurched forward to finish him with never
a chance of getting up; but now old Captain Briggs
had Hal by the arm again.</p>

<p>“Hal, Hal!” he entreated. “For God’s sake&mdash;”</p>

<p>Once more Hal threw the old man off. The second’s
delay rescued McLaughlin from annihilation. Dazed,
bleeding at mouth and nose, he staggered to his feet
and with good science plunged into a clinch.</p>

<p>This unexpected move upset Hal’s tactics of smashing
violence. The Scot’s long, wiry arms wrapped
round him, hampering his fist-work. Hal could do no
more than drive in harmless blows at the other’s back.
They swayed, tripped over a hawser, almost went
down. From the crew and from the wharf ragged
shouts arose, of fear, anger, purely malicious delight,
for here was battle-royal of the finest. The sound of
feet, running down the wharf, told of other contingents
hastily arriving.</p>

<p>“By gum!” approved the helmsman, forgetting to
chew. He had more than once felt the full weight of
McLaughlin’s fist. “By gum, now, but Mac’s in f’r<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a good takin’-down. If that lad don’t fist him proper,
I miss my ’tarnal guess. Sick ’im, boy!”</p>

<p>Blaspheming, Hal tore McLaughlin loose, flung him
back, lowered his head and charged. But now the
Scot had recovered a little of his wit. On deck he spat
blood and a broken snag of tooth. His eye gleamed
murderously. The excess of Hal’s rage betrayed the
boy. His guard opened. In drove a stinging lefthander.
McLaughlin handed him the other fist, packed
full of dynamite. The boy reeled, gulping.</p>

<p>“Come on, ye college bratlin’!” challenged the fighting
Scot, and smeared the blood from his mouth.
“This here ain’t your ship&mdash;not yet!”</p>

<p>“My ship’s any ship I happen to be on!” snarled
Hal, circling for advantage. Mac had already taught
him to be cautious. Old Captain Brigg’s imploring
cries fell from him, unheeded. “If this <i>was</i> my ship,
I’d wring your neck, so help me God! But as it is, I’ll
only mash you to a jelly!”</p>

<p>“Pretty bairn!” gibed McLaughlin, hunched into
battle-pose, bony fists up. “Grandad’s pretty pet!
Arrrh! Ye <i>would</i>, eh?” as Hal bored in at him.</p>

<p>He met the rush with cool skill. True, Hal’s right
went to one eye, closing it; but Hal felt the bite of
knuckles catapulted from his neck.</p>

<p>Hal delayed no more. Bull-like, he charged. By
sheer weight and fury of blows he drove Mac forward
of the schooner, beside the deck-house. Amid turmoil,
the battle raged. The jostling crowd, shoved and
pushed, on deck and on the wharf, to see this epic war.
Bets were placed, even money.</p>

<p>McLaughlin, panting, half-blind, his teeth set in a
grin of rage, put every ounce he had left into each
blow. But Hal outclassed him.</p>

<p>A minute, two minutes they fought, straining, sweating,
lashing. Then something swift and terrible connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with Mac’s jaw-point in a jolt that loosened his
universe. Mac’s head snapped back. His arms flung
up. He dropped, pole-axed, into the scuppers.</p>

<p>For the first time in five-and-twenty years of fighting,
clean and dirty, Fergus McLaughlin had taken a
knockout.</p>

<p>A mighty shout of exultation, fear and rage loosened
echoes from the old fish-sheds. Three or four of the
crew came jostling into the circle, minded to avenge
their captain. Sneering, his chest heaving, but ready
with both fists, Hal faced them.</p>

<p>“Come on, all o’ you!” he flung, drunk with rage,
his face bestial. A slaver of bloody froth trickled from
the corner of his mouth. “Come on!”</p>

<p>They hesitated. Gorilla-like, he advanced. Back
through the crowd the overbold ones drew. No heart
remained in them to tackle this infuriated fighting-machine.</p>

<p>Hal set both fists on his hips, flung up his head and
panted:</p>

<p>“Apologize, will I? I, a passenger on this lousy
tub, I’ll apologize to a bunch of down-east rough-necks,
eh? If there’s anybody else wants any apology, I’m
here!”</p>

<p>None caught up the gage of battle. Bursting with
fury that had to vent itself, Hal swung toward McLaughlin.
The Scot had landed on a coil of hawser in
the scuppers, that had somewhat broken his fall. Hal
reached down, hauled him up and flung him backward
over the rail. Thrice he struck with a fist reddened by
McLaughlin’s blood. He wrenched at the unconscious
man’s arm, snarling like an animal, his face distorted,
eyes glazed and staring. A crunching told of at least
one broken bone.</p>

<p>Shouts of horror fell unheeded from his ears. He
glared around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“My Gawd, he’s a-killin’ on him!” quavered a voice.
“We can’t stan’ by an’ see him do murder!”</p>

<p>Old Briggs, nerved to sudden action, ran forward.</p>

<p>“Hal! For God’s sake, Hal!”</p>

<p>“You stand back, grandad! He’s my meat!”</p>

<p>Hal raised McLaughlin high above his head, with a
sweep of wonderful power. He dashed the Scot to
the bare planks with a horrible, dull crash, hauled back
one foot and kicked the senseless man full in the
mangled, blood-smeared face.</p>

<p>A communal gasp of terror rose up then. Men
shrank and quivered, stricken with almost superstitious
fear. All had seen fights aplenty; most of them had
taken a hand in brawls&mdash;but here was a new kind of
malice. And silence fell, tense, heart-searching.</p>

<p>Hal faced the outraged throng, and laughed with
deep lungs.</p>

<p>“There’s your champion, what’s left of him!” cried
he. “<i>He</i> won’t bullyrag anybody for one while, believe
me. Take him&mdash;I’m through with him!”</p>

<p>Of a sudden the rage seemed to die in Hal, spent in
that last, orgiastic convulsion of passion. He turned
away, flung men right and left, and leaped down the
companion. Swiftly he emerged with a suit-case. To
his trembling, half-fainting grandfather he strode, unmindful
of the murmur of curses and threats against
him.</p>

<p>“Come on, grandpop!” he said in a more normal
tone. His voice did not tremble, as will the voice of
almost every man after a storm of rage. His color
was fresh and high, his eyes clear; his whole ego
seemed to have been vivified and freshened, like a sky
after tempest. “Come along, now. I’ve had enough
of this rotten old hulk. I’ve given it what it needed, a
good clean-up. Come on!”</p>

<p>He seized Captain Briggs by the elbow&mdash;for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
old man could hardly stand, and now was leaning
against the hatchway housing&mdash;and half guided, half
dragged him over the rail to the wharf.</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Hal Briggs!” exclaimed an old
lobsterman. “This here’s a bad day’s work you’ve
done. When he was down, you booted him. We
wun’t fergit it, none of us wun’t.”</p>

<p>“No, and <i>he</i> won’t forget it, either, the bragging
bucko!” sneered Hal. “Uncle Silas, you keep out of
this!”</p>

<p>“Ef that’s what they l’arn ye down to college,”
sounded another voice, “you’d a durn sight better stay
to hum. We fight some, on the North Shore, but we
fight fair.”</p>

<p>Hal faced around, with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“Who said that?” he gritted. “Where’s the son
of a pup that said it?”</p>

<p>No answer. Cowed, everybody held silence. No
sound was heard save the shuffling feet of the men
aboard, as some of the crew lifted McLaughlin’s limp
form and carried it toward the companion, just as
Crevay had been carried on the <i>Silver Fleece</i>, half a
century before.</p>

<p>“Come on, gramp!” exclaimed Hal. “For two
cents I’d clean up the whole white-livered bunch. Let’s
go home, now, before there’s trouble.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m afraid I can’t walk, Hal,” quavered the
old man. “This has knocked me galley-west. My
rudder’s unshipped and my canvas in rags. I can’t
navigate at all.” He was trembling as with a chill.
Against his grandson he leaned, ashen-faced, helpless.
“I can’t make Snug Haven, now.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, grampy,” Hal assured him.
“We’ll dig up a jitney if you can get as far as the
street. Come on, let’s move!”</p>

<p>With unsteady steps, clinging to Hal’s arm and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
by the dog, old Captain Briggs made his way up
Hadlock’s Wharf. Only a few minutes had elapsed
since he had strode so proudly down that wharf, but
what a vast difference had been wrought in the captain’s
soul! All the glad elation of his heart had now
faded more swiftly than a tropic sunset turns to dark.
The old man seemed to have shrunken, collapsed.
Fifteen little minutes seemed to have bowed down his
shoulders with at least fifteen years.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hal, Hal!” he groaned, as they slowly made
their way towards the street. “Oh, my boy, how could
you ha’ done that?”</p>

<p>“How could I? After what he said, how <i>couldn’t</i>
I?”</p>

<p>“What a disgrace! What a burning, terrible disgrace!
You&mdash;just back from college&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There, there, grandpop, it’ll be all right. Everybody’ll
be glad, when they cool off, that I handed it to
that bully.”</p>

<p>“This will make a terrible scandal. The <i>Observer</i>
will print it, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You don’t think they’d waste paper
on a little mix-up aboard a coasting-schooner, do
you?”</p>

<p>“This is more than a little mix-up, Hal. You’ve
stove that man’s hull up, serious. There’s more storm
brewing.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean, more storm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll take this to court. He’ll sue for damages.”</p>

<p>“He’d better not!” snapped Hal, grimly. “I’ve
got more for him, where what I handed him came from,
if he tries it!”</p>

<p>“Hal, you’re&mdash;breaking my old heart.”</p>

<p>“D’you think, grandpa, I was going to stand there
and swallow his insults? Do you think I, a Briggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was going to let that slab-sided P.I. hand me that
rough stuff? Would <i>you</i> have stood for it?”</p>

<p>“I? What do you mean? How could I fight, at
my age?”</p>

<p>“I mean, when you were young. Didn’t <i>you</i> ever
mix it, then? Didn’t you have guts enough to put up
your fists when you had to? If you didn’t, you’re no
grandfather of mine!”</p>

<p>“Hal,” answered the old man, still holding to his
grandson as they neared the street, “what course I
sailed in my youth is nothing for you to steer by now.
Those were rough days, and these are supposed to be
civilized. That was terrible, terrible, what you did to
McLaughlin. The way you flung him across the rail,
there, and then to the deck, and&mdash;kicked him, when he
was down&mdash;kicked him in the face&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I tell you!” Hal asserted, vigorously.
He laughed, with glad remembrance. “When I fight
a gentleman, I fight like a gentleman. When I fight a
ruffian, I use the same tactics. That’s all such cattle
understand. My motto is to hit first, every time.
That’s the one best bet. The second is, hit hard. If
you’re in a scrap, you’re in it to win, aren’t you?
Hand out everything you’ve got&mdash;give ’em the whole
bag of tricks, all at one wallop. That’s what <i>I</i> go by,
and it’s a damn good rule. You, there! Hey, there,
jitney!”</p>

<p>The discussion broke off, short, as Hal sighted a little
car, cruising slowly and with rattling joints over
the rough-paved cobbles.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAPTAIN COMMANDS</p>

<p>The jitney stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Sam! That you?” asked Hal, recognizing
the driver.</p>

<p>“Horn spoon! Ef it ain’t Hal!” exclaimed the
jitney-man. “Back ag’in, eh? What the devil <i>you</i>
been up to? Shirt tore, an’ one eye looks like you’d
been&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” Hal answered, while certain taggers-on
stopped at a respectful distance. “I’ve just
been arguing with McLaughlin, aboard the <i>Sylvia
Fletcher</i>. It’s nothing at all.” He helped his grandfather
into the car and then, gripping the Airedale so
that it yelped with pain, he pitched it in. “How much
do you want to take us down to Snug Haven?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;that’ll be a dollar ’n’ a half, seein’ it’s you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get one nice, round little buck, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Git out! You, an’ the cap’n, an’ the dog, an’ a
tussik! Why&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hal climbed into the car. He leaned forward, his
face close to Sam’s. The seethe of rage seemed to
have departed. Now Hal was all joviality. Swiftly
the change had come upon him.</p>

<p>“Sam!” he admonished. “You know perfectly
well seventy-five cents would be robbery, but I’ll give
you a dollar. Put her into high.”</p>

<p>The driver sniffed Hal’s breath, and nodded acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, seein’ as it’s you,” he answered. He
added, in a whisper: “Ain’t got nothin’ on y’r hip, have
ye?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but a bruise,” said Hal. “<i>Clk-clk!</i>”</p>

<p>The jitney struck its bone-shaking gait along the
curving street of Endicutt. No one spoke. The old
captain, spent in forces and possessed by bitter, strange
hauntings, had sunk far down in the seat. His beard
made a white cascade over the smart blue of his coat.
His eyes, half-closed, seemed to be visioning the far-off
days he had labored so long to forget. His face
was gray with suffering, beneath its tan. His lips
had set themselves in a grim, tight line.</p>

<p>As for Hal, he filled and lighted his pipe, then with
a kind of bored tolerance eyed the quaint old houses,
the gardens and trim hedges.</p>

<p>“Some burg!” he murmured. “Some live little
burg to put in a whole summer! Well, anyhow, I
started something. They ought to hand me a medal,
for putting a little pep into this prehistoric graveyard.”</p>

<p>Then he relapsed into contemplative smoking.</p>

<p>Presently the town gave place to the open road along
the shore, now bathed in a thousand lovely hues as
sunset died. The slowly fading beauty of the seascape
soothed what little fever still remained in Hal’s blood.
With an appreciative eye he observed the harbor. The
town itself might seem dreary, but in his soul the instinctive
love of the sea awoke to the charms of that
master-panorama which in all its infinite existence has
never twice shown just the same blending of hues, of
motion, of refluent ebb and fall.</p>

<p>Along the dimming islands, swells were breaking into
great bouquets of foam. The murmurous, watery cry
of the surf lulled Hal; its booming cadences against the
rocky girdles of the coast seemed whispering alluring,
mysterious things to him. In the offing a few faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
specks of sail, melting in the purple haze, beckoned:
“Come away, come away!”</p>

<p>To Captain Briggs quite other thoughts were coming.
Not now could the lure of his well-loved ocean appeal
to him, for all the wonders of the umber and dull orange
west. Where but an hour ago beauty had spread
its miracles across the world, for him, now all had
turned to drab. A few faint twinkles of light were
beginning to show in fishers’ cottages; and these, too,
saddened the old captain, for they minded him of Snug
Haven’s waiting lights&mdash;Snug Haven, where he had
hoped so wonderfully much, but where now only
mournful disillusion and bodings of evil remained.</p>

<p>The ceaseless threnody of the sea seemed to the old
man a requiem over dead hopes. The salt tides seemed
to mock and gibe at him, and out of the pale haze drifting
seaward from the slow-heaving waters, ghosts
seemed beckoning.</p>

<p>All at once Hal spoke, his college slang rudely jarring
the old captain’s melancholy.</p>

<p>“That was some jolt I handed Mac, wasn’t it?” he
laughed. “He’ll be more careful who he picks on next
time. That’s about what he needed, a good walloping.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What?” murmured the old man, roused
from sad musings.</p>

<p>“Such people have to get it handed to them once in
a while,” the grandson continued. “There’s only one
kind of argument they understand&mdash;and that’s this!”</p>

<p>He raised his right fist, inspected it, turning it this
way and that, admiring its massive power, its adamantine
bone and sinew.</p>

<p>“Oh, for Heaven’s sake, Hal, don’t do that!” exclaimed
the captain. With strange eyes he peered at
the young man.</p>

<p>Hal laughed uproariously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some fist, what?” he boasted. “Some pacifier!”</p>

<p>As he turned toward the old man, his breath smote
the captain’s senses.</p>

<p>“Lord, Hal! You haven’t been drinking, have
you?” quavered Briggs.</p>

<p>“Drinking? Well&mdash;no. Maybe I’ve had one or
two, but that’s all.”</p>

<p>“One or two what, Hal?”</p>

<p>“Slugs of rum.”</p>

<p>“Rum! Good God!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, now? What’s the harm in a
drop of good stimulant? I asked him for a drink, and
he couldn’t see it, the tightwad! I took it, anyhow.
That’s what started all the rough-house.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, Hal! D’you mean to tell me
you’re drinking, now?”</p>

<p>“There, there, gramp, don’t get all stewed up. All
the fellows take a drop now and then. You don’t want
me to be a molly-coddle, do you? To feel I can’t take
a nip, once in a while, and hold it like a gentleman?
That’s all foolishness, grampy. Be sensible!”</p>

<p>The old man began to shiver, though the off-shore
breeze blew warm. Hal made a grimace of vexation.
His grandfather answered nothing, and once more
silence fell. It lasted till the first scattering houses of
South Endicutt came into view in the fading light.</p>

<p>The driver, throwing a switch, sent his headlights
piercing the soft June dusk. The cones of radiance
painted the roadside grass a vivid green, and made the
whitewashed fences leap to view. Hedges, gardens,
gable-ends, all spoke of home and rest, peace and the
beatitude of snug security. Somewhere the sound of
children’s shouts and laughter echoed appealingly.
The tinkle of a cow-bell added its music; and faint in
the western sky, the evening star looked down.</p>

<p>And still Captain Briggs held silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>A little red gleam winked in view&mdash;the port light
of Snug Haven.</p>

<p>“There’s the old place, isn’t it?” commented Hal,
in a softer tone. He seemed moved to gentler
thoughts; but only for a moment. His eye, catching
a far, white figure away down by the smithy, brightened
with other anticipations than of getting home
again.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed. “That’s Laura, isn’t it?
Look, gramp&mdash;isn’t that Laura Maynard?”</p>

<p>Peering, Captain Briggs recognized the girl. He
understood her innocent little subterfuge of being out
for a casual stroll just at this time. His heart, already
lacerated, contracted with fresh pain.</p>

<p>“No, no, Hal,” he exclaimed. “That can’t be
Laura. Come now, don’t be thinking about Laura, to-night.
You’re tired, and ought to rest.”</p>

<p>“Tired? Say, that’s a good one! When was I
ever tired?”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I’m</i> tired, anyhow,” the captain insisted,
“and I want to cast anchor at the Haven. We’ve got
company, too. It wouldn’t look polite, if you went
gallivanting&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Company? What company?” demanded Hal, as
the car drew up toward the gate.</p>

<p>“A very special friend of mine. A man I haven’t
seen in fifty years. An old doctor that once sailed
with me. He’s waiting to see you, now.”</p>

<p>“Another old pill, eh?” growled the boy, sullenly,
his eyes still fixed on the girl at the bend of the road.
“There’ll be time enough for Methuselah, later. Just
now, it’s me for the skirt!”</p>

<p>The car halted. The captain stiffly descended. He
felt singularly spent and old. Hal threw out the
suit-case, and lithely leaped to earth.</p>

<p>“Dig up a bone for Sam, here,” directed Hal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
“Now, I’ll be on my way to overhaul the little dame.”</p>

<p>“Hal! That’s <i>not</i> Laura, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“You can’t kid me, grampy! That’s the schoolma’m,
all right. I’d know her a mile off. She’s some
chicken, take it from me!”</p>

<p>“Hal, I protest against such language!”</p>

<p>“Oh, too rough, eh?” sneered the boy. “Now in
your day, I suppose you used more refined English,
didn’t you? Maybe you called them&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hal! That will do!”</p>

<p>“So will Laura, for me. She’s mine, that girl is.
She’s plump as a young porpoise, and I’m going after
her!”</p>

<p>The captain stood aghast, at sound of words that
echoed from the very antipodes of the world and of his
own life. Then, with a sudden rush of anger, his face
reddening formidably, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Not another word! You’ve been drinking, and
you’re dirty and torn&mdash;no fit man, to-night, to haul up
’longside that craft!”</p>

<p>“I tell you, I’m going down there to say good evening
to Laura, anyhow,” Hal insisted, sullenly. “I’m
going!”</p>

<p>“You are <i>not</i>, sir!” retorted Briggs, while Sam, in
the car, grinned with enjoyment. “You’re <i>not</i> going
to hail Laura Maynard to-night! Do you want to lose
her friendship and respect?”</p>

<p>“Bull! Women like a little rough stuff, now and
then. This ‘Little Rollo’ business is played out. Go
along in, if you want to, but I’m going to see Laura.”</p>

<p>“Hal,” said the old man, a new tone in his voice.
“This is carrying too much canvas. You’ll lose some
of it in a minute, if you don’t reef. I’m captain here,
and you’re going to take my orders, if it comes to that.
The very strength you boast of and misuse so brutally
is derived from money I worked a lifetime for, at sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and suffered and sinned and bled and almost died for!”
The old captain’s tone rang out again as in the old,
tempestuous days when he was master of many hard
and violent men. “Now, sir, you’re going to obey me,
or overside you go, this minute&mdash;and once you go,
you’ll never set foot on my planks again! Pick up
your dunnage, sir, and into the Haven with you!”</p>

<p>“Good <i>night</i>!” ejaculated Hal, staring. Never
had the old man thus spoken to him. Stung to anger,
though Hal was, he dared not disobey. Muttering,
he picked up the suit-case. The dog, glad to be at
home once more, leaped against him. With an oath,
Hal swung the suit-case; the Airedale, yelping with
pain, fawned and slunk away.</p>

<p>“Into the Haven with you!” commanded Briggs,
outraged to his very heart. “<i>Go!</i>”</p>

<p>Hal obeyed, with huge shoulders hulking and drooping
in their plenitude of evil power, just like the captain’s,
so very long ago. Alpheus Briggs peered down
the street at the dim white figure of the disappointed
girl; then, eyes agleam and back very straight, he followed
Hal toward Snug Haven&mdash;the Haven which in
such beatitude of spirit he had left but an hour ago&mdash;the
Haven to which, filled with so many evil bodings,
he now was coming back again.</p>

<p>“Oh, God,” he murmured, “if this thing must come
upon me, Thy will be done! But if it can be turned
aside, spare me! Spare me, for this is all my life and
all my hope! Spare me!”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">SPECTERS OF THE PAST</p>

<p>Hal’s boots, clumping heavily on the porch, aroused
the captain from his brief revery of prayer. Almost
at once the new stab of pain at realization that Dr.
Filhiol must see Hal in this disheveled, half-drunken
condition brought the old man sharply back to earth
again. Bitter humiliation, brutal disillusionment, sickening
anti-climax! The captain stifled a groan. Fate
seemed dealing him a blow unreasonably hard.</p>

<p>A chair scraped on the porch. Briggs saw the bent
and shriveled form of Dr. Filhiol arising. The doctor,
rendered nervous by the arsenal and by the cabinet
of curios, which all too clearly recalled the past, had
once more gone out upon the piazza, to await the captain’s
return. Warmed by the egg-nog within, and
outwardly by a shawl that Ezra had given him, now he
stood there, leaning on his cane. A smile of anticipation
curved his shaven, bloodless lips. His eyes blinked
eagerly behind his thick-lensed glasses.</p>

<p>“Home again, eh?” he piped. “Good! So then
this is the little grandson back from college? Little!
Ha-ha! Why, captain, he’d make two like us!”</p>

<p>“This is Hal,” answered the captain briefly. “Yes,
this is my grandson.”</p>

<p>The doctor, surprised at Briggs’s curt reply, put out
his hand. Hal took it as his grandfather spoke the
doctor’s name.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, doctor!” said he in a sullen
voice, and let the hand drop. “Excuse me, please!
I’ll go in and wash up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned toward the door. With perturbation
Filhiol peered after him. Then he glanced at the captain.
Awkwardly silence fell, broken by a cry of joy
from the front door.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master Hal!” ejaculated Ezra. “Ef it ain’t
Master Hal!”</p>

<p>The servitor’s long face beamed with jubilation as he
seized the suit-case with one hand and with the other
clapped Hal on the shoulder. “Jumpin’ jellyfish, but
you’re lookin’ fine an’ stout! Back from y’r books,
ain’t ye? Ah, books is grand things, Master Hal,
’specially check-books, pocketbooks, an’ bank-books.
Did the cap’n tell ye? He did, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Ez!” answered Hal, still very glum. “Tell
me what?”</p>

<p>“‘Bout the plum-cake an’ lamb?” asked Ezra anxiously
as Hal slid past him into the house. “I remembered
what you like, Master Hal. I been workin’ doggone
hard to git everythin’ jest A1 fer you!”</p>

<p>His voice grew inaudible as he followed Hal into
Snug Haven. The captain and the doctor gazed at
each other a long, eloquent moment in the vague light.
Neither spoke. Filhiol turned and sat down, puzzled,
oppressed.</p>

<p>Briggs wearily sank into another chair. Hal’s feet
stumbling up the front stairs echoed with torment
through his soul. Was that the stumbling of haste,
or had the boy drunk more than he had seemed to?
The captain dropped his cap to the porch-floor. Not
now did he take pains to hang it on top of the rocking-chair.
He wiped his forehead with his silk handkerchief,
and groaned.</p>

<p>The doctor kept silence. He understood that any
word of his would prove inopportune. But with pity
he studied the face of Captain Briggs, its lines accentuated
by the light from the window of the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the captain sighed deep and began:</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re here on my quarterdeck with me
to-night, doctor. Things are all going wrong, sir.
Barometer’s way down, compass is bedeviled, seams
opening fore and aft. It’s bad, doctor&mdash;very, very
bad!”</p>

<p>“I see there’s something wrong, of course,” said
Filhiol with sympathy.</p>

<p>“Everything’s wrong, sir. That grandson of mine&mdash;you&mdash;noticed
just what was the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“H-m! It’s rather dark here, you know,” hedged
Filhiol.</p>

<p>“Not so dark but what you understood,” said Briggs
grimly. “When there’s a storm brewing no good
navigator thinks he can dodge it by locking himself in
his cabin. And there <i>is</i> a storm brewing this time, a
hurricane, sir, or I’ve missed all signals.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean, captain?”</p>

<p>“Violence, drink, women&mdash;wickedness and sin!
You smelled his breath, didn’t you? You took an observation
of his face?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. He’s been drinking a little, of course;
but these boys in college&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He very nigh killed the skipper of the <i>Sylvia
Fletcher</i>, and there’ll be the devil to pay about it. It
was just luck there wasn’t murder done before my very
eyes. He’s been drinking enough so as to wake a
black devil in his heart! Enough so he’s like a roaring
bull after the first pretty girl in the offing.”</p>

<p>“There, there, captain!” The doctor tried to
soothe him, his thin voice making strange contrast
with the captain’s booming bass. “You’re probably
exaggerating. A little exuberance may be pardoned in
youth,” his expression belied his words. “Remember,
captain, when <i>you</i> were&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just what’s driving me on the rocks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
grief and despair!” the old man burst out, gripping
the arms of the rocker. “God above! It’s just the
realization of my own youth, flung back at me now,
that’s like to kill me! That boy, so help me&mdash;why,
he’s thrown clean back fifty years all at one crack!”</p>

<p>“No, no, not that!”</p>

<p>“He has, I tell you! He’s jumped back half a century.
<i>He</i> don’t belong in this age of airplanes and
wireless. <i>He</i> belongs back with the clipper-ships
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, captain, and you know it!”</p>

<p>“It’s far from nonsense! There’s a bad strain
somewhere in my blood. I’ve been afraid a long time
it was going to crop out in Hal. There’s always been
a tradition in my family of evil doings now and then.
I don’t know anything certain about it, though, except
that my grandfather, Amalfi Briggs, died of bursting a
blood-vessel in his brain in a fit of rage. That was all
that saved him from being a murderer&mdash;he died before
he could kill the other man!”</p>

<p>Silence came, save for the piping whistle of an urchin
far up the road. The ever-rising, falling suspiration
of the sea breathed its long caress across the land, on
which a vague, pale sheen of starlight was descending.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from abovestairs, sounded a dull, slamming
sound as of a bureau-drawer violently shut. Another
slam followed; and now came a grumbling of
muffled profanity.</p>

<p>“All that saved my grandfather from being a murderer,”
said Briggs dourly, “was the fact that he
dropped dead himself before he could cut down the
other man with the ship-carpenter’s adze he had in his
hand.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Your grandfather must have been rather
a hard specimen.”</p>

<p>“Only when he was in anger. At other times you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
never saw a more jovial soul! But rage made a beast
of him!”</p>

<p>“How was your father?”</p>

<p>“Not that way in the least. He was as consistently
Christian a man as ever breathed. My son&mdash;Hal’s
father&mdash;was a good man, too. Not a sign of that
sort of brutality ever showed in him.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re worrying unnecessarily,” judged the
doctor. “Your grandson may be wild and rough at
times, but he’s tainted with no hereditary stain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, doctor,” said the captain
earnestly. “For a year or two past he’s been showing
more temper than a young man should. He’s not
been answering the helm very well. Two or three of
the village people here have already complained to me.
I’ve never been really afraid till to-night. But now,
doctor, I <i>am</i> afraid&mdash;terribly, deadly afraid!”</p>

<p>The old man’s voice shook. Filhiol tried to smile.</p>

<p>“Let the dead past bury its dead!” said he. “Don’t
open the old graves to let the ghosts of other days walk
out again into the clear sunset of your life.”</p>

<p>“God knows I don’t want to!” the old man exclaimed
in a low, trembling voice. “But suppose
those graves open themselves? Suppose they won’t
stay shut, no, not though all the good deeds from here
to heaven were piled atop of them, to keep them down?
Suppose those ghosts rise up and stare me in the eyes
and won’t be banished&mdash;what then?”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” gibed Filhiol, though his
voice was far from steady. “You’re not yourself,
captain. You’re unnerved. There’s nothing the
matter with that boy except high spirits and overflowing
animal passions.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I understand only too well. God is being
very hard to me! I sinned grievous, in the long
ago! But I’ve done my very best to pay the reckoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Seems like I haven’t succeeded. Seems like God don’t
forget! He’s paying me now, with interest!”</p>

<p>“Captain, you exaggerate!” the doctor tried to assure
him, but Briggs shook his head.</p>

<p>“Heredity skips that way sometimes, don’t it?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;sometimes. But that doesn’t prove anything.”</p>

<p>“No, it don’t prove anything, but what Hal did to-night
<i>does</i>! Would a thing like that come on sudden
that way? Would it? A kind of hydrophobia of rage
that won’t listen to any reason but wants to break and
tear and kill? I mean, if that kind of thing was in
the blood, could it lay hid a long time and then all of a
sudden burst out like that?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes. It might.”</p>

<p>“I seem to remember it was the same with me the
first time I ever had one of those mad fits,” said the
captain. “It come on quick. It wasn’t like ordinary
getting mad. It was a red torrent, delirious and awful&mdash;something
that caught me up and carried me along
on its wave&mdash;something I couldn’t fight against.
When I saw Hal with his teeth grinning, eyes glassy,
fists red with McLaughlin’s blood, oh, it struck clean
through my heart!</p>

<p>“It wasn’t any fear of either of them getting killed
that harpooned me, no, nor complications and damages
to pay. No, no, though such will be bad enough.
What struck me all of a heap was to see myself, my
very own self that used to be. If I, Captain Alpheus
Briggs, had been swept back to 1868 and set down on
the deck of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>, Hal would have been my
exact double. I’ve seen myself just as I was then,
doctor, and it’s shaken me in every timber. There I
stood, I, myself, in Hal’s person, after five decades of
weary time. I could see the outlines of the same black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
beard on the same kind of jaw&mdash;same thick neck and
bloody fists; and, oh, doctor, the eyes of Hal. His
eyes!”</p>

<p>“His eyes?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In them I saw my old, wicked, hell-elected
self&mdash;saw it glaring out, to break and ravish and
murder!”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs!”</p>

<p>“It’s true, I’m telling you. I’ve seen a ghost this
evening. A ghost&mdash;”</p>

<p>He peered around fearfully in the dusk. His voice
lowered to a whisper:</p>

<p>“A ghost!”</p>

<p>Filhiol could not speak. Something cold, prehensile,
terrible seemed fingering at his heart! Ruddy,
the Airedale, raised his head, seemed to be listening, to
be seeing something they could not detect. In the
dog’s throat a low growl muttered.</p>

<p>“What’s <i>that</i>?” said the captain, every muscle taut.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” the doctor answered. “The
dog probably hears some one down there by the hedge.
This is all nonsense, captain. You’re working yourself
into a highly nervous state and imagining all kinds of
things. Now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tell you, I saw the ghost of my other self,” insisted
Briggs. “There’s worse kinds of ghosts than
those that hang around graveyards. I’ve always
wanted to see that kind and never have. Night after
night I’ve been up there to the little cemetery on Croft
Hill, and sat on the bench in our lot, just as friendly
and receptive as could be, ready to see whatever ghost
might come to me, but none ever came. I’m not afraid
of the ghosts of the dead! It’s ghosts of the living
that strike a dread to me&mdash;ghosts of the past that
ought to die and can’t&mdash;ghosts of my own sins that
God won’t let lie in the grave of forgiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>S-h-h-h!</i>” exclaimed the doctor. He laid a hand
on the captain’s, which was clutching the arm of the
rocker with a grip of steel. “Don’t give way to such
folly! Perhaps Hal did drink a little, and perhaps he
did thrash a man who had insulted him. But that’s
as far as it goes. All this talk about ghosts and some
hereditary, devilish force cropping out again, is pure
rubbish!”</p>

<p>“I wish to God above it <i>was</i>!” the old man groaned.
“But I know it’s not. It’s there, doctor, I tell you!
It’s still alive and in the world, more terrible and more
malignant than ever, a living, breathing thing, evil
and venomous, backed up with twice the intelligence
and learning I ever had, with a fine, keen brain to direct
it and with muscles of steel to do its bidding!
Oh, God, I know, I <i>know</i>!”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs, sir,” the doctor began. “This is
most extraordinary language from a man of your common
sense. I really do not understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” interrupted the captain, raising his right
hand. On the stairway feet echoed. “Hush! He’s
coming down!”</p>

<p>Silent, tense, they waited. The heavy footfalls
reached the bottom of the stair and paused there a
moment. Briggs and the doctor heard Hal grumbling
something inarticulate to himself. Then he walked
into the cabin.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">DR. FILHIOL STANDS BY</p>

<p>Through the window both men could see him. The
cabin-lamp over the captain’s table shed soft rays upon
the boy as he stood there unconscious of being observed.</p>

<p>He remained motionless a moment, gazing about
him, taking account of any little changes that had
been wrought in the past months. At sight of him the
old captain, despite all his bodings of evil, could not but
thrill with pride of this clean-limbed, powerful-shouldered
grandson, scion of the old stock, last survivor of
his race, and hope of all its future.</p>

<p>Hal took a step to the table. The lithe ease and
power of his stride impressed the doctor’s critical eye.</p>

<p>“He’s all right enough, captain,” growled Filhiol.
“He’s as normal as can be. He’s just overflowing
with animal spirits, strength, and energy. Lord!
What wouldn’t you or I give to be like that&mdash;again?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stand in those boots of his for all the
money in Lloyd’s!” returned the captain in a hoarse
whisper. “For look you, doctor, I have lived my life
and got wisdom. My fires have burned low, leaving
the ashes of peace&mdash;or so I hope. But that lad there,
ah! there’s fires and volcanoes enough ahead for him!
Maybe those same fires will kindle up my ashes, too,
and sear my heart and soul! I thought I was entitled
to heave anchor and lay in harbor a spell till I get my
papers for the unknown port we don’t any of us come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
back from, but maybe I’m mistaken. Maybe that’s not
to be, doctor, after all.”</p>

<p>“What rubbish!” retorted Filhiol. “Look at him
now, will you? Isn’t he peaceful, and normal enough
for anybody? See there, now, he’s going to take a
book and read it like any well-behaved young man.”</p>

<p>Hal had, indeed, taken a book from the captain’s
table and had sat down with it before the fireplace.
He did not, however, open the book. Instead, he
leaned back and gazed intently up at the arsenal. He
frowned, nodded, and then broke into a peculiar smile.
His right fist clenched and rose, as if in imagination he
were gripping one of those weapons, with Fergus McLaughlin
as his immediate target.</p>

<p>Silence fell once more, through which faintly penetrated
the far-off, nasal minor of old Ezra, now engaged
upon an endless chantey recounting the adventures
of one “Boney”&mdash;<i>alias</i> Bonaparte. Peace
seemed to have descended upon Snug Haven, but only
for a minute.</p>

<p>For all at once, with an oath of impatience, Hal
flung the book to the floor. He stood up, thrust both
hands deep into his pockets, and fell to pacing the floor
in a poisonous temper.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he stopped, wheeled toward the captain’s
little private locker and strode to it. The locker
door was secured with a brass padlock of unusual
strength. Hal twisted it off between thumb and finger
as easily as if it had been made of putty. He flung
open the door, and took down a bottle.</p>

<p>He seized a tumbler and slopped it levelful of whisky,
which he gulped without a wink. Then he smeared his
mouth with the back of his hand and stood there evil-eyed
and growling.</p>

<p>“<i>Puh!</i> That’s rotten stuff!” he ejaculated.
“Grandpop certainly does keep a punk line here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>”
Back upon the shelf he slammed the bottle and the glass.
“Wonder where that smooth Jamaica’s gone he used
to have?”</p>

<p>“God above! Did you see that, doctor?” breathed
the old captain, gripping at the doctor’s hand. “He
downed that like so much water. Isn’t that the exact
way I used to swill liquor? By the Judas priest, I’ll
soon stop <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>Filhiol restrained him.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he cautioned as the two old men peered in,
unseen, through the window. “Even that doesn’t
prove the original sin you seem determined to lay at
the boy’s door. He’s unnerved after his fight. Let’s
see what he’ll do next. If we’re going to judge him,
we’ve got to watch a while.”</p>

<p>Old Briggs sank back into his chair, and with eyes
of misery followed the boy, hope of all his dreams.
Hal’s next move was not long delayed.</p>

<p>“Ezra!” they heard him harshly call. “You,
Ezra! Come <i>here</i>!”</p>

<p>The chantey came to a sudden end. A moment, and
Ezra appeared in the doorway leading from the cabin
to the “dining-saloon.”</p>

<p>“Well, Master Hal, what is it?” smiled the cook,
beaming with affection. In one hand he held a “copper,”
just such as aboard the <i>Silver Fleece</i> had heated
water for the scalding of the Malays. “What d’you
want, Master Hal?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Ezra,” said the boy arrogantly, “I’ve
been trying to find the rum grandpop always keeps in
there. Couldn’t locate it, so I’ve been giving this
whisky a trial, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When whisky an’ young men lay ’longside one another,
the whisky don’t want a trial. It wants lynchin’!”</p>

<p>“I’m not asking <i>your</i> opinion!” sneered Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m givin’ it, Master Hal,” persisted Ezra.
“When the devil goes fishin’ fer boys, he sticks a petticoat
an’ a bottle o’ rum on the hook.”</p>

<p>“Get me the Jamaica, you!” demanded Hal with
growing anger. “I’ve got no time for your line of
bull!”</p>

<p>“Lots that ain’t got no time for nothin’ in this world
will have time to burn in the next! You’ll get no rum
from me, Master Hal. An’ what’s more, if I’d ha’
thought you was goin’ to slip your cable an’ run ashore
in any such dognation fool way on a wave o’ booze, I’d
of hid the whisky where <i>you</i> wouldn’t of run it
down!”</p>

<p>“You’d have hidden it!” echoed Hal, his face darkening,
the veins on neck and forehead beginning to
swell. “You’ve got the infernal nerve to stand there&mdash;you,
a servant&mdash;and tell me you’d hide anything
away from me in my own house?”</p>

<p>“This here craft is registered under your grandpa’s
name an’ is sailin’ under his house-flag,” the old cook
reminded him. His face was still bland as ever, but in
his eyes lurked a queer little gleam. “It ain’t the same
thing at all&mdash;not yet.”</p>

<p>“Damn your infernal lip!” shouted Hal, advancing.
Captain Briggs, quivering, half-rose from his chair.
“You’ve got the damned impudence to stand there and
dictate to <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Master Hal,” retorted Ezra with admirable self-restraint,
“you’re sailin’ a bit too wide wide o’ your
course now. There’s breakers ahead, sir. Look
out!”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve been at the Jamaica yourself, you
thieving son of Satan!” snarled Hal. “I’ll not stand
here parleying with a servant. Get me that Jamaica,
or I’ll break your damned, obstinate neck!”</p>

<p>“Now, Master Hal, I warn you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To hell with you!”</p>

<p>“With me, Master Hal? With old Ezra?”</p>

<p>“With everything that stands in my way!”</p>

<p>Despite Hal’s furious rage the steadfast old sailor-man
still resolutely faced him. Captain Briggs, now
again hearing almost the identical words he himself
had poured out in the cabin of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>, sank
back into his chair with a strange, throaty gasp.</p>

<p>“Doctor!” he gulped. “Do you hear that?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” the doctor cautioned, leaning forward.
“This is very strange. It is, by Jove, sir! Some
amazing coincidence, or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Next thing you know he’ll knock Ezra down!”
whispered the captain, staring. He seemed paralyzed,
as though tranced by the scene. “That’s what I did to
the cabin-boy, when my rum was wrong. Remember?
It’s all coming round again, doctor. It’s a nightmare
in a circle&mdash;a fifty-year circle! Remember Kuala
Pahang? She&mdash;she died! I wonder what woman’s
got to die this time?”</p>

<p>“That’s all pure poppycock!” the doctor ejaculated.
He was trembling violently. With a great effort, leaning
heavily on his stick, he arose. Captain Briggs,
too, shook off the spell that seemed to grip him and
stood up.</p>

<p>“Hal!” he tried to articulate; but his voice failed
him. Turning, he lurched toward the front door.</p>

<p>From within sounded a cry, a trampling noise.
Something clattered to the floor.</p>

<p>“Hal! My God, Hal!” the captain shouted
hoarsely.</p>

<p>As he reached the door Ezra came staggering out
into the hall, a hand pressed to his face.</p>

<p>“Ezra! What is it? For Heaven’s sake, Ezra,
what’s Hal done to you?”</p>

<p>The old man could make no answer. Limply he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sagged against the newel-post, a sorry picture of grief
and pain. The captain put an arm about his shoulders,
and with burning indignation cried:</p>

<p>“What did he do? Hit you?”</p>

<p>Ezra shook his head in stout negation. Even
through all the shock and suffering of the blow, his
loyalty remained sublimely constant.</p>

<p>“Hit me? Why, no, sir,” he tried to smile, though
his lips were white. “<i>He</i> wouldn’t strike old Ezra.
There’s no mutiny aboard this little craft of ours.
Two gentlemen may disagree, an’ all that, but as fer
Master Hal strikin’ me, no, <i>sir</i>!”</p>

<p>“But I heard him say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothin’, cap’n,” the old cook insisted,
still, however, keeping his cheek-bone covered with his
hand. “Boys will be boys. They’re a bit loose with
their jaw-tackle, maybe. But there, there, don’t you
git all har’red up, captain. Men an’ pins is jest alike,
that way&mdash;no good ef they lose their heads. Ca’m
down, cap’n!”</p>

<p>“What’s that on your face. Blood?”</p>

<p>“Blood, sir? How would blood git on my doggone
face, anyhow? That’s&mdash;h-m&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you lie to me, Ezra! I’m not blind. He cut
you with something! What was it?”</p>

<p>“Honest to God, cap’n, he never! I admit we had
a bit of an argyment, an’ I slipped an’ kind of fell ag’in’
the&mdash;the binnacle, cap’n. I’ll swear that on the ship’s
Bible!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you stand there and perjure your immortal
soul just to shield that boy!” Briggs sternly reproved,
loving the old man all the more for the brave lie. “But
I know you will, anyhow. What authority have I got
aboard my own ship, when I can’t even get the truth?
Ezra, you wouldn’t admit it, if Hal took that kris in
there and cut your head off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“How could I then, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Ezra! Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ll damn soon find out!” the captain cried, stung
to the first profanity of years. He tramped into the
cabin, terrible.</p>

<p>“Come here, sir!” he cried in a tone never before
heard in Snug Haven.</p>

<p>No answer. Hal was not there. Neither was the
bottle of whisky. A chair had been tipped over, and
on the floor lay the captain’s wonderful chronometer,
with shattered glass.</p>

<p>This destruction, joined to Ezra’s innocent blood,
seemed to freeze the captain’s marrow. He stood there
a moment, staring. Then, wide-eyed, he peered
around.</p>

<p>“Mutiny and bloodshed,” he whispered. “God deliver
us from what’s to be! Hal Briggs, sir!” he
called crisply. “Come here!” The captain, terrible
in wrath, strode through the open door.</p>

<p>A creaking of the back stairs constituted the only
answer. The captain hurried up those stairs. As he
reached the top he heard the door of Hal’s room shut,
and the key turn.</p>

<p>“You, sir!” he cried, knocking violently at the
panels. A voice issued:</p>

<p>“It’s no use, gramp. I’m not coming out, and
you’re not coming in. It’s been nothing but hell ever
since I struck this damn place. If it doesn’t stop I’m
going to get mad and do some damage round here.
All I want now is to be let alone. Go ’way, and don’t
bother me!”</p>

<p>“Hal! Open that door, sir!”</p>

<p>Never a word came back. The captain knocked and
threatened, but got no reply.</p>

<p>At last, realizing that he was only lowering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
dignity by such vain efforts, he departed. His eyes
glowered strangely as he made his way down-stairs.</p>

<p>Ezra had disappeared. But the old doctor was
standing in the hallway, under the gleam of a ship’s
lantern there. He looked very wan and anxious.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said he, with timid hesitation. “I feel
that my presence may add to your embarrassment.
Therefore, I think I had best return to Salem this evening.
If you will ask Ezra to harness up my horse,
I’ll be much obliged.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothing of the kind, doctor! You’re my
friend and my guest, and you’re not going to be driven
out by any such exhibition of brutal bad manners! I
ask you, sir, to stay. I haven’t seen you for fifty years,
sir; and you do no more than lay ’longside, and then
want to hoist canvas again and beat away? Never,
sir! Here you stay, to-night, aboard me. There’s a
cabin and as nice a berth as any seafaring man could
ask. Go and leave me now, would you? Not much,
sir!”</p>

<p>“If you really want me to stay, captain&mdash;”</p>

<p>Briggs took Filhiol by the hand and looked steadily
into his anxious, withered face.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, in a deep, quiet tone. “I’m in
trouble, doctor. Deep, black, bitter trouble. Nobody
in this world but you can help me steer a straight course
now, if there’s any way <i>to</i> steer one, which God grant!
Stand by me now, doctor. You did once before on the
old <i>Silver Fleece</i>. I’ve got your stitches in me yet.
Now, after fifty years, I need you again, though it’s
worse this time than any knife-cut ever was. Stand
by me, doctor, for a little while. That’s all I ask.
<i>Stand by!</i>”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SUNSHINE</p>

<p>The miracle of a new day’s sunshine&mdash;golden over
green earth, foam-collared shore and shining sea&mdash;brought
another miracle almost as great as that which
had transformed somber night to radiant morning.
This miracle was the complete reversal of the situation
at Snug Harbor, and the return of peace and happiness.
But all this cannot be told in two breaths. We
must not run too far ahead of our story.</p>

<p>So, to go on in orderly fashion we must know that
Ezra’s carefully prepared supper turned out to be a
melancholy failure. The somber dejection of the three
old men at table, and then the miserable evening of the
captain and the doctor on the piazza, talking of old
days with infinite regret, of the present with grief and
humiliation, of the future with black bodings, made a
sorry time of it all.</p>

<p>Night brought but little sleep to Captain Briggs.
The doctor slept well enough, and Ezra seconded him.
But the good fortune of oblivion was not for the old
captain. Through what seemed a black eternity he lay
in the bunk in his cabin, brooding, agonizing, listening
to the murmur of the sea, the slow tolling of hours
from the tall clock in the hallway. The cessation of
the ticking of his chronometer left a strange vacancy
in his soul. Deeply he mourned it.</p>

<p>After an infinite time, half-sleep won upon him,
troubled by ugly dreams. Alpheus Briggs seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
behold again the stifling alleyways of the Malay town,
the carabaos and chattering gharrimen, the peddlers and
whining musicians, the smoky torch-flares and dark,
slow-moving river. He seemed to smell, once more,
the odors of spice and curry, the smoke of torches and
wood fires, the dank and reeking mud of the marshy,
fever-bitten shore.</p>

<p>And then the vision changed. He was at sea again;
witnessing the death of Scurlock, the boy and Kuala
Pahang, in the blood-tinged waters. Came the battle
with the Malays, in the grotesque exaggerations of a
dream; and then the torments of the hell-ship, cargoing
slaves. The old captain seemed stifled by the reek
and welter of that freight; he seemed to hear their
groans and cries&mdash;and all at once he heard again, as
in a voice from infinite distances, the curse of Shiva,
flung at him by Dengan Jouga, witch-woman of the
Malay tribesmen:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The evil spirit will pursue you, even beyond the wind,
even beyond the Silken Sea! Vishnu will repay you! Dead
men shall come from their graves, like wolves, to follow you.
Birds of the ocean foam will poison you. Life will become
to you a thing more terrible than the venom of the katchubong
flower, and evil seed will grow within your heart.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Evil seed will grow and flourish there, dragging you
down to death, down to the longing for death, and yet you
cannot die! And the blind face in the sky will watch you,
<i>sahib</i>&mdash;watch you, and laugh, because you cannot die!
That is the curse of Vishnu on your soul!”</p>

<p class="p1">In the captain’s dream, the groaning and crying of
the wounded and perishing men aboard the <i>Silver
Fleece</i> seemed to blend with that of the dying
slaves. And gradually all this echoing agony transmuted
itself into a sinister and terrible mirth, a horrifying,
ghastly laughter, far and strange, ceaseless,
monotonous, maddening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhere in a boundless sky of black, the captain
seemed to behold a vast spiral, whirling, ever-whirling
in and in; and at its center, vague, formless yet filled
with menace, he dimly saw an eyeless face, indeed, that
still for all its blindness seemed to be watching him.
And as it watched, it laughed, blood-freezingly.</p>

<p>Captain Briggs roused to his senses. He found
himself sitting up in bed, by the open window, through
which drifted the solemn roar and hissing backwash of
a rising surf. A pallid moon-crescent, tangled in spun
gossamer-fabric of drifting cloud, cast tenuous, fairy
shadows across the garden. Staring, the captain
rubbed his eye.</p>

<p>“Judas priest!” he muttered. “What&mdash;where&mdash;Ah!
Dreaming, eh? Only dreaming? Thank God
for that!”</p>

<p>Then, with a pang of transfixing pain, back surged
memories of what had happened last night. He slid
out of bed, struck a match and looked at his watch.
The hour was just a bit after two.</p>

<p>Noiselessly Briggs crept from his room, climbed the
stairs and came to Hal’s door. The menace of Kuala
Pahang still weighed terribly upon him. Something
of the vague superstitions of the sea seemed to have
infused themselves into the captain’s blood. Shuddering,
he remembered the curse that now for years
had lain forgotten in the dusty archives of his youth;
remembered even more than he had dreamed; remembered
the words of the <i>nenek kabayan</i>, the witch-woman&mdash;that
strange, yellow, ghostlike creature
which had come upon him silently over his rum and
gabbling in the cabin of the hell-ship:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Something you love&mdash;love more than your own life&mdash;will
surely die. You will die then, but still you will not die.
You will pray for death, but death will mock and will not
come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The old captain shivered as he stood before the door
of Hal’s room. Suppose the ancient curse really had
power? Suppose it should strike Hal, and Hal should
die! What then?</p>

<p>For a moment he heard nothing within the room,
and his old heart nearly stopped, altogether. But
almost at once he perceived Hal’s breathing, quiet
and natural.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God!” the captain murmured, his soul
suddenly expanding with blest relief. He remained
there a while, keeping silent vigil at the door of his
well-loved boy. Then, satisfied that all was well, he
retraced his steps, got back into bed, and so presently
fell into peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>A knocking at his door, together with the voice of
Ezra, awoke him.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs, sir! It’s six bells o’ the mornin’
watch. Time to turn out!”</p>

<p>The captain blinked and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Come in, Ezra,” bade he, mustering his wits.
“H-m!” he grunted at sight of Ezra’s cheek-bone
with an ugly cut across it. “The doctor up yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s been cruisin’ out ’round the lawn
an’ garden an hour. He’s real interestin’, ain’t he?
But he’s too kind o’ mournful-like to set right on <i>my</i>
stomach. Only happy when he’s miserable. Men’s
different, that way, sir. Some heaves a sigh, where
others would heave a brick.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Ezra. What’s there to record on the
log, so far?” asked Briggs, anxiously.</p>

<p>“First thing this <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> I’m boarded by old Joe
Pringle, the peddler from Kittery. Joe, he wanted to
sell us anythin’ he could&mdash;a jew’s-harp, history o’
the world, Salvation Salve, a phonograft, an Eyetalian
queen-bee, a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold hard! I don’t care anything about Joe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
What’s the news this morning about&mdash;about&mdash;”</p>

<p>“News, sir? Well, the white Leghorn’s bringin’
off a nestful. Five’s hatched already. Nature’s
funny, ain’t it? We git chickens from eggs, an’ eggs
from chickens, an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> you stop your fool talk?” demanded the
captain. He peered at Ezra with disapproval. To
his lips he could not bring a direct question about the
boy; and Ezra was equally unwilling to introduce the
subject, fearing lest some word of blame might be
spoken against his idol. “Tell me some news, I say!”
the captain ordered.</p>

<p>“News, cap’n? Well, Dr. Filhiol, there, fed his
nag enough of our chicken-feed to last us a week.
The doc, he calls the critter, Ned. But I think Sea
Lawyer would be ’bout right.”</p>

<p>“Sea Lawyer? How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it <i>can</i> draw a conveyance, but it’s doggone
poor at it.”</p>

<p>“Stop your foolishness, Ezra, and tell me what I
want to know. How’s Hal this morning? Where
is he, and what’s he doing?”</p>

<p>“Master Hal? Why, he’s all right, sir.”</p>

<p>“He is, eh?” The captain’s hands were clenched
with nervousness.</p>

<p>Ezra nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye worry none about Master Hal,” said he
gravely. “Worry’s wuss’n a dozen leaks an’ no
pump. Ef ye <i>must</i> worry, worry somebody else.”</p>

<p>“What’s the boy doing? Drinking again?”</p>

<p>“Not a drink, cap’n. Now my idea about liquor
is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Judas priest!” interrupted Briggs. “You’ll drive
me crazy! If the world was coming to an end you’d
argue with Gabriel. You say Hal’s not touched it
this morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nary drop, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s good news!”</p>

<p>“Good news is like a hard-b’iled egg, cap’n. You
don’t have to break it easy. Hal’s fine an’ fit this
mornin’, sir. I thought maybe he might hunt a little
tot o’ rum, this mornin’, but no; no, sir, he’s sober
as a deacon. The way he apologized was as han’some.”</p>

<p>“Apologized? Who to?”</p>

<p>“Me an’ the doctor. He come out to the barn,
an’ begged our pardons in some o’ the doggondest
purtiest language I ever clapped an ear to. He’s slick.
Everythin’s all right between Master Hal an’ I an’
the doctor. After he apologized he went fer a swim,
down to Geyser Rock.”</p>

<p>“Did, eh? He’s wonderful in the water! Not
another man in <i>this</i> town dares take that dive. I&mdash;I’m
mighty glad he had the decency to apologize.
Hal’s steering the right course now. He’s proved
himself a man anyhow. Last night I’d almost lost
faith in him and in all humanity.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so important fer a man to have faith in
humanity as fer humanity to have faith in him,” affirmed
the old cook. “Now, cap’n, you git up, please.
You’ll want to see Master Hal afore breakfast. Listen
to me, cap’n, don’t never drive that boy out, same’s
I was drove. Master Hal’s sound an’ good at heart.
But he’s had his own head too long now fer you to
try rough tactics.”</p>

<p>“Rough! When was I ever rough with Hal?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe if you had of been a few times when he
was small it’d of been better. But it’s too late now.
Let him keep all canvas aloft; but hold a hard helm
on him. Hold it hard!”</p>

<p>The sound of singing somewhere across the road
toward the shore drew the captain’s attention out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
window. Striding home from his morning plunge,
Hal was returning to Snug Harbor, “coming up with
a song from the sea.”</p>

<p>The captain put on his bathrobe, then went to the
window and sat down there. He leaned his arms on
the sill, and peered out at Hal. Ezra discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>No sign seemed visible on Hal of last night’s rage
and war. Sleep, and the exhilaration of battling with
the savage surf along the face of Geyser Rock, had
swept away all traces of his brutality. Molded into
his wet bathing-suit that revealed every line of that
splendidly virile body, he drew near.</p>

<p>All at once he caught sight of Captain Briggs. He
stopped his song, by the lantern-flanked gateway, and
waved a hand of greeting.</p>

<p>“Top o’ the morning to you, grandfather!” cried
he. There he stood overflooded with life, strength,
spirits. His body gleamed with glistening brine; his
face, lighted by a smile of boyish frankness, shone in
the morning sun. His thick, black hair that he had
combed straight back with his fingers, dripped seawater
on his bronzed, muscular shoulders.</p>

<p>“God, what a man!” the captain thought. “Hard
as nails, and ridged with muscle. He’s only twenty-one,
but he’s better than ever I was, at my best!”</p>

<p>And once again, he felt his old heart expand with
pride and hope&mdash;hope that reached out to lay eager
hold upon the future and its dreams.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, sir, before breakfast,” said the
captain.</p>

<p>Hal nodded comprehension. From the hedge he
broke a little twig, and held it up.</p>

<p>“Here’s the switch, gramp,” said he whimsically.
“You’d better use it now, while I’ve got bare legs.”</p>

<p>The old man had to smile. With eyes of profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
affection he gazed at Hal. Sunlight on his head and
on Hal’s struck out wonderful contrasts of snow and
jet. The luminous, celestial glow of a June morning
on the New England coast&mdash;a morning gemmed with
billions of dewdrops flashing on leaf and lawn, a
morning overbrooded by azure deeps of sky unclouded&mdash;folded
the world in beauty.</p>

<p>A sense of completion, of loveliness fulfilled compassed
everything. Autumn looks back, regretfully.
Winter shivers between memories and hopes. Spring
hopes more strongly still&mdash;but June, complete and
resting, says: “Behold!”</p>

<p>Such was that morning; and the captain, looking
at his boy, felt its magic soothing the troubled heart
within him. On the lawn, two or three robins were
busy. Another, teetering high on the plumy crest of a
shadowing elm, was emptying its heart of melody.</p>

<p>A minute, old man and young looked steadily at
each other. Then Hal came up the white-sanded
walk, between the two rows of polished conches. He
stopped at the old man’s window.</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” said he in a low tone. “Will you
listen to me, please?”</p>

<p>“What have you got to say, sir?” demanded Briggs,
and stiffened his resolution. “Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“Listen, grandfather,” answered Hal, in a very
manly way, that harmonized with his blue-eyed look,
and with his whole air of ingenuous and boyish contrition.
He crossed his bare arms, looked down a
moment at the sand, dug at it a little with a toe, and
then once more raised his head. “Listen, please.
I’ve got just one thing to ask. Please don’t lecture
me, and don’t be harsh. I stand here absolutely penitent,
grandfather, begging to be forgiven. I’ve already
apologized to Dr. Filhiol and Ezra&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So I understand,” put in Briggs, still striving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hard to make his voice sound uncompromising.
“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, grandfather&mdash;as for apologizing to you,
that’s kind of a hard proposition. It isn’t that I don’t
want to, but the relations between us have been so
close that it’s pretty hard to make up a regular apology.
You and I aren’t on a basis where I really <i>could</i>
apologize, as I could to anybody else. But I certainly
did act the part of a ruffian on the <i>Sylvia Fletcher</i>,
and I was certainly a rotter here last night. There’s
only one other thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what’s that, sir?” demanded Briggs. The
captain still maintained judicial aloofness, despite all
cravings of the heart. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;you may not believe it, gramp, but it’s true.
I really don’t remember hardly anything about what
happened aboard the schooner or here. I suppose I
can’t stand even a couple of drinks. It all seems hazy
to me now, like a kind of nightmare. It’s all indistinct,
as if it weren’t me at all, but somebody else.
I feel just as if I’d been watching another man do
the things that I really know I myself <i>did</i> do. The
feeling is that somebody else took my body and used
it, and made it do things that I myself didn’t want
it to do. But I was powerless to stop it. Grampy,
it’s true, true, <i>true</i>!”</p>

<p>He paused, looking at his grandfather with eyes
of tragic seriousness. Old Briggs shivered slightly,
and drew the bathrobe more tightly around his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Go on, Hal.”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t much more to say. I know
there’ll be consequences, and I’m willing to face them.
I’ll cut out the booze altogether. It was foolish of
me to get into it at all, but you know how it is at
college. They all kidded me, for not drinking a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and so&mdash;well. It’s my own fault, right enough.
Anyhow, I’m done. You’ll forget it and forgive it,
won’t you, grandpa?”</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> I, my boy?” the old man answered. He
blinked to keep back the tears. “You know the answer,
already!”</p>

<p>“You really mean that, gramp?” exclaimed Hal,
with boyish enthusiasm. “If I face the music, whatever
it is, and keep away from any encores, will you
let me by, this time?”</p>

<p>The captain could answer only by stretching out his
hand and gripping Hal’s. The boy took his old,
wrinkled hand in a grip heartfelt and powerful. Thus
for a moment the two men, old and young, felt the
strong pressure of palms that cemented contrition and
forgiveness. The captain was first to speak.</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right now, Hal,” said he, “so
far’s I’m concerned. Whatever’s wrong, outside Snug
Haven, can be made right. I know you’ve had your
lesson, boy.”</p>

<p>“I should say so! I don’t need a second.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You’ll remember this one, right enough.
Well, now, least said soonest mended. It was pretty
shoal water there, one while. But we’re floating again,
and we’re not going to run on to any more sandbars,
are we? Ah, there’s Ezra blowing his bo’sun’s whistle
for breakfast. Let’s see which of us gets to mess-table
first!”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">DARKENING SHADOWS</p>

<p>Breakfast&mdash;served on a regulation ship’s table, with
swivel-chairs screwed to the floor and with a rack
above for tumblers and plates&mdash;made up by its overflowing
happiness for all the heartache of the night
before. Hal radiated life and high spirits. The captain’s
forebodings of evil had vanished in his newly-revivified
hopes. Dr. Filhiol became downright cheerful,
and so far forgot his nerves as to drink a cup
of weak coffee. As for Ezra, he seemed in his best
form.</p>

<p>“Judgin’ by your togs, Master Hal,” said he, as
Hal&mdash;breakfast done&mdash;lighted his pipe and blew
smoke up into the sunlit air, “I cal’late Laura Maynard’s
got jest the same chances of not takin’ a walk
with you, this mornin’, that Ruddy, here, has got of
learnin’ them heathen Chinee books o’ yourn. It says
in the Bible to love y’r neighbor as y’rself, so you got
Scripture backin’ fer Laura.”</p>

<p>“Plus the evidence of my own senses, Ezra,”
laughed the boy, as he drew at his pipe. His fresh-shaven,
tanned face with those now placid blue eyes
seemed to have no possible relation with the mask
of vicious hate and rage of the night before.</p>

<p>As he sat there, observing Ezra with a smile, he
appeared no other than an extraordinary well-grown,
powerfully developed young man.</p>

<p>“Must have been the rum that did it,” the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
tried to convince himself. “Works that way with
some people. They lose all anchors, canvas, sticks
and everything&mdash;go on the rocks when they’ve only
shipped a drink or two. There’ll be no more rum for
Hal. He’s passed his word he’s through. That
means he <i>is</i> through, because whatever else he may
or may not be, he’s a Briggs. So then, that’s settled!”</p>

<p>“Now that you’ve put me in mind of Laura, I
think I <i>will</i> take a walk down-street,” said Hal. “I
might just possibly happen to meet her. Glad you
reminded me, Ezra.”</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t need much remindin’,” replied
the old cook solemnly. “But sail a steady course an’
don’t carry too much canvas. You’re too young a
cap’n to be lookin’ for a mate, on the sea o’ life.
Go slow. You can’t never tell what a woman or a
jury’ll do, an’ most women jump at a chanst quicker
’n what they do at a mouse. Go easy!”</p>

<p>“For an old pair of scissors with only one blade,
you seem to understand the cut of the feminine gender
pretty well,” smiled the boy.</p>

<p>“Understand females?” replied Ezra, drawing out
a corn-cob and a pouch of shag. “Not me! Some
men think they do, but then, some men is dum fools.
They’re dangerous, women is. No charted coast, no
lights but love-light, an’ that most always turns out
to be a will-o’-the-wisp, that piles ye up on the rocks.
When a man gits stuck on a gal, seems like he’s like
a fly stuck on fly-paper&mdash;sure to git his leg pulled.”</p>

<p>Hal laughed again, and departed with that kind of
casual celerity which any wise old head can easily
interpret. Ezra, striking into a ditty with a monotonous
chorus of “Blow the man down,” began gathering
up the breakfast-dishes. The captain and his guest
made their way to the quarterdeck and settled themselves
in rockers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Briggs had hardly more than lighted his pipe, when
his attention was caught by a white-canvas-covered
wagon, bearing on its side the letters: “R. F. D.”</p>

<p>“Hello,” said he, a shade of anxiety crossing his
face. “Hello, there’s the mail.”</p>

<p>He tried to speak with unconcern, but into his voice
crept foreboding that matched his look. As he strode
down the walk, Filhiol squinted after him.</p>

<p>“It’s a sin and shame, the way he’s worried now,”
the doctor murmured. “That boy’s got the devil in
him. He’ll kill the captain, yet. A swim, a shave
and a suit of white flannels don’t change a man’s heart.
What’s bred in the bone&mdash;”</p>

<p>Captain Briggs came to a stand at the gate. His
nervousness betrayed itself by the thick cloud of tobacco-smoke
that rose from his lips. Leisurely the
mail-wagon zigzagged from side to side of the street
as the postman slid papers and letters into the boxes
and hoisted the red flags, always taking good care
that no card escaped him, unread.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, cap’n,” said the postman. “Here’s your
weather report, an’ here’s your ‘Shippin’ News.’ An’
here’s a letter from Boston, from the college. You
don’t s’pose Hal’s in any kind o’ rookus down there,
huh? An’ here’s a letter from Squire Bean, down
to the Center. Don’t cal’late there’s any law-doin’s,
do you?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded the captain, trying
to keep a brave front. “What could there be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>you</i> know, ’bout how Hal rimracked McLaughlin.
I heered tell, down-along, he’s goin’ to
sue for swingein’ damages. Hal durn nigh killed the
critter.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all talkin’. An’ I see Mac, myself,
goin’ inta the squire’s house on a crutch an’ with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
arm in a sling, early this mornin’. This here letter
must of been wrote right away after that. Course
I hope it ain’t nuthin’, but looks to me like ’tis.
Well&mdash;”</p>

<p>He eyed the captain expectantly, hoping the old
man might open the letter and give the news which he
could bear to all and sundry. But, no; the captain
merely nodded, thrust the letters into the capacious
breast-pocket of his square-rigged coat and with a
non-committal “Thank you,” made his way back to
the piazza.</p>

<p>His shoulders drooped not, neither did his step
betray any weakness. The disgruntled postman muttered
something surly, clucked to his horse, and in
disappointment pursued his business&mdash;the leisurely
handling of Uncle Sam’s mail and everybody’s private
affairs.</p>

<p>The same robin&mdash;or perhaps, after all, it was a
different one&mdash;was singing in the elm, as Alpheus
Briggs returned to the house. Down the shaded
street the metallic rhythm of the anvil was breaking
through the contrabass of the surf. But now this
melody fell on deaf ears, for Captain Briggs. Heavily
he came up the steps, and with weariness sank down
in the big rocker. Sadly he shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s come, I’m afraid,” said he dejectedly. “I
was hoping it wouldn’t. Hoping McLaughlin would
let it go. But that was hoping too much. He’s
no man to swallow a beating. See here now, will
you?”</p>

<p>The captain pulled out his letter from Squire Bean,
and extended it to Filhiol.</p>

<p>“Local attorney?” asked the doctor, with a look
of anxiety.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the captain. “This letter means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
only one thing. Barometer’s falling again. We’ll
have to take in more canvas, sir.”</p>

<p>He tore the envelope with fingers now trembling.
The letter revealed a crabbed hand-writing, thus:</p>

<p class="pbqr4 p1">Endicutt, Massachusetts,</p>
<p class="pbqr2">June 19, 1918.</p>

<p class="pbqn"><span class="smcap">Captain Alpheus Briggs</span>,</p>
<p class="pbqi4">South Endicutt.</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Captain Fergus McLaughlin has placed in my
hands the matter of the assault and battery committed upon
him by your grandson, Hal Briggs. Captain McLaughlin is
in bad shape, is minus a front tooth, has his right arm broke,
and cannot walk without a crutch. You are legally liable
for these injuries, and would be immediately summoned into
court except Capt. McLaughlin has regard for your age and
position in the community. There is, however, no doubt,
legal damages coming to the Capt. If you call, we can discuss
amt. of same, otherwise let the law take its course.</p>

<p class="pbqr8">Resp’ly,</p>
<p class="pbqr4"><span class="smcap">Johab Bean</span>, J. P.,</p>
<p class="pbqr2">Ex-Candidate for Judge of Dis’t Court.</p>

<p class="p1">Captain Briggs read this carefully, then, tugging
at his beard, passed it over to Dr. Filhiol.</p>

<p>“It’s all as I was afraid it would be,” said the
captain. “McLaughlin’s not going to take the medicine
he’s really deserved for long years of buckoing
poor devils. No, doctor. First time he meets a <i>man</i>
that can stand up to him and pay him back with interest,
he steers a course for the law. That’s your
bully and your coward! Thank God, for all my doings,
I never fought my fights before a judge or jury!
It was the best man win, fist to fist, or knife to knife
if it came to that&mdash;but the law, sir, never!”</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Filhiol.
“I’m afraid you’re in for whacking damages. Hal’s
lucky that he wasn’t a signed-on member of the crew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
There’d have been mutiny for you to get him out of,
and iron bars. Lucky again, he didn’t hit just a trifle
harder. If he had, it might have been murder, and
in this State they send men to the chair for that.
Yes, captain, you’re lucky it’s no worse. If you have
only a hundred or two dollars to pay for doctor’s bills
and damages, you’ll be most fortunate.”</p>

<p>“A hundred or two dollars!” ejaculated the captain.
“Judas priest! You don’t think there’ll be
any such bill as that for repairs and demurrage on
McLaughlin’s hulk, do you?”</p>

<p>“I think that would be a very moderate sum,” answered
Filhiol. “I’m willing to stand back of you,
captain, all the way. I’ll go into court and examine
McLaughlin, myself, as an expert witness. It’s more
than possible Squire Bean is exaggerating, to shake
you down.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stand back of me, doctor?” exclaimed the
captain, his face lighting up. “You’ll go into court,
and steer me straight?”</p>

<p>“By all means, sir!”</p>

<p>Briggs nearly crushed the doctor’s hand in a powerful
grip.</p>

<p>“Well spoken, sir!” said he. “It’s like you, doctor.
Well, all I can do is to thank you, and accept
your offer. That puts a better slant to our sails, right
away. Good, sir&mdash;very, very good!”</p>

<p>His expression was quite different as he tore open
the letter from the college. Perhaps, after all, this
was only some routine communication. But as he
read the neat, typewritten lines, a look of astonishment
developed; and this in turn gave way to a most
pitiful dismay.</p>

<p>The captain’s hands were shaking, now, so that he
could hardly hold the letter. His face had gone quite
bloodless. All the voice he could muster was a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of whispering gasp, as he stretched out the sheet of
paper to the wondering Filhiol:</p>

<p>“Read&mdash;read that, doctor! The curse&mdash;the
curse! Oh, God is being very hard on me, in my
old age! Read <i>that</i>!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">TROUBLED SOULS</p>

<p>Dr. Filhiol trembled as he took the letter and read:</p>

<p class="pbqr4 p1">Cambridge, Massachusetts,</p>
<p class="pbqr2">June 18, 1918.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I regret that I must write you again in regard to your
grandson, Haldane Briggs, but necessity leaves no choice.
This communication does not deal with an unimportant
breach of discipline, such as we overlooked last year, but
involves matters impossible to condone.</p>

<p>During the final week of the college year Mr. Briggs’s
conduct cannot be too harshly stigmatized. Complaint has
been entered against him for gambling and for having appeared
on the college grounds intoxicated. On the evening
of Thursday last Mr. Briggs attempted to bring liquor into
a college dormitory, and when the proctor made a protest,
Mr. Briggs assaulted him.</p>

<p>In addition, we find your grandson has not applied the
money sent by you to the settlement of his term bill, but has
diverted it for his own uses. The bill is herewith enclosed,
and I trust that you will give it your immediate attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs, because of his undesirable habits, has not recently
been properly attending to his courses, with the exception
of his Oriental language work, in which he has
continued to take a real interest. His examination marks in
other studies have been so high as to lead to an inquiry, and
we find that Mr. Briggs has been hiring some person unknown
to take his place in three examinations and to pass
them for him&mdash;a form of cheating which the large size of
some of our courses unfortunately renders possible.</p>

<p>Any one of Mr. Briggs’s infractions of the rules would result
in his dismissal. Taken as a total, they render that dismissal
peremptory and final. I regret to inform you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
your grandson’s connection with the university is definitely
terminated.</p>

<p>Regretting that my duty compels me to communicate news
of such an unpleasant nature, I am,</p>
</div>

<p class="pbqr8">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pbqr2"><span class="smcap">Hawley D. Travers</span>, A.B., A.M., LL.B.</p>

<p class="reduct">To <span class="smcap">Captain Alpheus Briggs</span>,</p>
<p class="pbqr8">South Endicutt, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="p1">Down sank the head of Captain Briggs. The old
man’s beard flowed over the smart bravery of his
blue coat, and down his weather-hardened cheeks
trickled slow tears of old age, scanty but freighted
with a bitterness the tears of youth can never feel.</p>

<p>For a moment the captain sat annihilated under
life’s most grievous blow&mdash;futility and failure after
years of patient labor, years of saving and of self-denial,
of hopes, of dreams. One touch of the harsh
finger of Fate and all the gleaming iridescence of
the bubble had vanished. From somewhere dark and
far a voice seemed echoing in his ears:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Even though you flee to the ends of the earth, my curse
will reach you. You shall pray to die, but still you cannot
die! What is written in the Book must be fulfilled!”</p>

<p class="p1">Suddenly the captain got up and made his way into
the house. Like a wounded animal seeking its lair
he retreated into his cabin.</p>

<p>The doctor peered after him, letter in hand. From
the galley Ezra’s voice drifted in nasal song, with
words strangely trivial for so tragic a situation:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Blow, boys, blow, for Californ-io!<br />
There’s plenty of gold, so I’ve been told,<br />
On the banks of Sacramento!”</p>

<p class="p1">“H-m!” grunted the doctor. “Poor old captain!
God, but this will finish him! That Hal&mdash;damn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that Hal! If something would only happen to him
now, so I could have him for a patient! I’m a law-abiding
man, but still&mdash;”</p>

<p>In the cabin Briggs sank down in the big rocking-chair
before the fireplace. He was trembling. Something
cold seemed clutching at his heart like tentacles.
He looked about, as if he half-thought something were
watching him from the far corner. Then his eye fell
on the Malay kris suspended against the chimney.
He peered at the lotus-bud handle, the wavy blade of
steel, the dark groove where still lay the poison, the
<i>curaré</i>.</p>

<p>“Merciful God!” whispered Captain Briggs, and
covered his eyes with a shaking hand. He suddenly
stretched out hands that shook. “Oh, haven’t I suffered
enough and repented enough? Haven’t I labored
enough and paid enough?” He pressed a hand
to his forehead, moist and cold. “He’s all I’ve got,
Lord&mdash;the boy is all I’ve got! Take me, <i>me</i>&mdash;but
don’t let vengeance come through <i>him</i>! The sin was
mine! Let me pay! Don’t drag him down to hell!
Take me&mdash;but let him live and be a man!”</p>

<p>No answer save that Briggs seemed to hear the
words of the old witch-woman ringing with all the
force of long-repressed memories:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your blood, your blood I will have! Even though you
flee from me forever, your blood will I have!”</p>

<p class="p1">“Yes, yes! My blood, not his!” cried the old
captain, standing up. Haggard, he peered at the kris,
horrible reminder of a past he would have given life
itself to obliterate so that it might not go on forever
poisoning his race. There the kris hung like a sword
of Damocles forever ready to fall upon his heart and
pierce it. And all at once a burning rage and hate
against the kris flared up in him. That thing accursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
should be destroyed. No longer should it hang there
on his fireplace to goad him into madness.</p>

<p>Up toward the kris he extended his hand. For a
moment he dared not lay hold on it; but all at once
he forced himself to lift it from its hooks. At touch
of it again, after so long a time, he began to tremble.
But he constrained himself to study it, striving to
fathom what power lay in it. Peering with curiosity
and revulsion he noted the lotus-bud, symbol of sleep;
the keen edge spotted with dark stains of blood and
rust; the groove with its dried poison, one scratch
thereof a solvent for all earthly problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>And suddenly a new thought came to him. His
hand tightened on the grip. His head came up, his
eye cleared, and with a look half of amazement, half
triumph, he cried:</p>

<p>“I’ve got the answer here! The answer, so help
me God! Before that boy of mine goes down into
the gutter&mdash;before he defiles his family and all the
memories of his race, here’s the answer. Lord knows
I hope he will come about on a new tack yet and be
something he ought to be; but if he don’t, he’ll never
live to drag our family name down through the
sewer!”</p>

<p>Savage pride thrilled the old man. All his hope
yearned toward the saving of the boy; but, should
that be impossible, he knew Hal would not sink to the
dregs of life.</p>

<p>The kris now seemed beneficent to Captain Briggs.
Closely he studied the blade, and even drew his thumb
along the edge, testing its keenness. Just how, he
wondered, did the poison work? Was it painless?
Quick it was; that much he knew. Quick and sure.
Not in anger, but with a calm resolve he stood there,
thinking. And like the after-swells of a tempest, other
echoes now bore in upon him&mdash;echoes of words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
spoken half a hundred years ago by Mahmud Baba:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Even though I wash coal with rosewater a whole year
long, shall I ever make it white? Even though the rain fall
a whole year, will it make the sea less salt? One drop of
indigo&mdash;and lo! the jar of milk is ruined! Seed sown upon
a lake will never grow!”</p>

<p class="p1">Again the captain weighed the kris in hand.</p>

<p>“Maybe the singer was right, after all,” thought
he. “I’ve done my best. I’ve given all I had to
give. He’ll have his chance, the boy shall, but if,
after that&mdash;”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">PLANS FOR RESCUE</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, captain, what are you up to
there?”</p>

<p>The voice of Filhiol startled Briggs. In the door
of the cabin he saw the old man standing with a
look of puzzled anxiety. Through the window Filhiol
had seen him take down the kris; and, worried,
he had painfully arisen and had hobbled into the
house. “Better put that knife up, captain. It’s not
a healthy article to be fooling with.”</p>

<p>“Not, eh?” asked the captain. “Pretty bad
poison, is it?”</p>

<p>“Extremely fatal.”</p>

<p>“Even dried, this way?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Put it up, captain, I beg you!” The
doctor, more and more alarmed, came into the cabin.
“Put it up!”</p>

<p>“What does it do to you, this <i>curaré</i> stuff?” insisted
the captain.</p>

<p>“Various things. And then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you die? You surely die?”</p>

<p>“You do, unless one very special antidote is applied.”</p>

<p>“Nobody in this country has that, though!”</p>

<p>“Nobody but myself, so far as I know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it?” demanded the captain, amazed.
“Where the devil would <i>you</i> get it?”</p>

<p>“Out East, where you got that devilish kris! You
haven’t forgotten that Parsee in Bombay, who gave
me the secret cure, after I’d saved him from cholera?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
But that’s neither here nor there, captain! That kris
is no thing to be experimenting with. Put it up now,
I tell you! We aren’t going to have any foolishness,
captain. Not at our age, mind you! Put it up, now.”</p>

<p>Unwillingly the captain obeyed. He hung the
weapon up once more, while Filhiol eyed him with
suspicious displeasure.</p>

<p>“It would be more to the point to see how we’re
going to get the boy out of his trouble again,” the
doctor reproved. “If you can’t meet this problem
without doing something very foolish, captain, you’re
not the man I think you!”</p>

<p>Briggs made no answer, but hailed:</p>

<p>“Ezra! Oh, Ezra!”</p>

<p>The old man’s chantey&mdash;it now had to do with
one “Old Stormy,” alleged to be “dead and gone”&mdash;promptly
ceased. Footfalls sounded, and Ezra appeared.
The cut on his cheek showed livid in the
tough, leathery skin.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs, sir?” asked he.</p>

<p>“The doctor and I are going to take a little morning
cruise down to Endicutt in the tender&mdash;the buggy,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“An’ you want me to h’ist sail on Bucephalus, sir?
All right! That ain’t much to want, cap’n. Man
wants but little here below, an that’s jin’ly all he gits, as
the feller says. Right! The Sea Lawyer’ll be anchored
out front, fer you, in less time than it takes to
box the compass!”</p>

<p>Ezra saluted and disappeared.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I’d do without Ezra,” said the
captain. “There’s a love and loyalty in that old heart
of his that a million dollars wouldn’t buy. Ezra’s
been through some mighty heavy blows with me. If
either of us was in danger, he’d give his life freely, to
save us. No doubt of that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“None whatever,” assented the doctor, as they once
more made their way out to the porch. He blinked
at the shimmering vagrancy of light that sparkled
from the harbor through the fringe of birches and tall
pines along the shore. “Going down to see Squire
Bean? Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The quicker we settle that claim the better.
You’ll go with me, eh?”</p>

<p>“If I’m needed&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>are</i> needed!”</p>

<p>“All right. But, after that, I ought to be getting
back to Salem.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get back to nowhere!” ejaculated Briggs.
“They can spare you at the home a few days. You’re
needed here on the bridge while this typhoon is blowing.
Here you are and here you stay till the barometer
begins to rise!”</p>

<p>“All right, captain, as you wish,” he conceded, his
will overborne by the captain’s stronger one. “But
what’s the program?”</p>

<p>“The program is to pay off everything and
straighten that boy out and make him walk the chalk-line.
Between the four of us&mdash;you and I and Laura
and Ezra&mdash;if we can’t do it, we’re not much good,
are we?”</p>

<p>“Laura? Who is this Laura, anyhow? What
kind of a girl is she?”</p>

<p>“The very best,” answered Briggs proudly. “Hal
wouldn’t go with any other kind. She’s the daughter
of Nathaniel Maynard, owner of a dozen schooners.
A prettier girl you never laid eyes to, sir!”</p>

<p>“Educated woman?”</p>

<p>“Two years through college. Then her mother had
a stroke, and Laura’s home again. She’s taken the
village school, just to fill up her time. A good girl, if
there ever was one. Good as gold, every way. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
needn’t say more. I love her like a daughter. I
suppose if I could have my dearest wish&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d have Hal marry her?”</p>

<p>“Just that; and I’d see the life of my family carried
on stronger, better and more vigorous. I’d see a child
or two picking the flowers here, and feel little hands
tugging at my old gray beard and&mdash;but, Judas priest!
I’m getting sentimental now. No more of that, sir!”</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” the doctor said in another
tone. “We’ve got more than just Hal to save.
We’ve got a woman’s happiness to think of. She
cares for him, you think?”</p>

<p>Briggs nodded silently.</p>

<p>“It’s quite to be expected,” commented the doctor.
“He certainly can be charming when he tries. There’s
only one fly in the honey-pot. Just one&mdash;his unbridled
temper and his seemingly utter irresponsibility.</p>

<p>“You know yourself, captain, his actions this morning
have been quite amazing. He starts out to see
this girl of his, right away, without giving his bad
conduct a second thought. The average boy, expelled
from college, would have come home in sackcloth
and ashes and would have told you all about it.
Hal never even mentioned it. That’s almost incredible.”</p>

<p>“Hal’s not an average kind of boy, any more than <i>I</i>
was!” put in the captain proudly.</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t seem to be,” retorted the physician,
peppery with infirmity and shaken nerves.
“However, I’m your guest and I won’t indulge in
any personalities. Whatever comes I’m with you!”</p>

<p>The captain took his withered hand in a grip that
hurt, and for a moment there was silence. This
silence was broken by the voice of Ezra, driving down
the lane:</p>

<p>“All ready, cap’n! All canvas up, aloft an’ alow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
an’ this here craft ready to make two knots an hour
ef she don’t founder afore you leave port! Fact is, I
think Sea Lawyer’s foundered already!”</p>

<p>Together captain and doctor descended the path to
the front gate. In a few minutes Ezra, bony hands on
hips, watched the two men slowly drive from sight
round the turn by the smithy. Grimly the old fellow
shook his head and gripped his pipe in some remnants
of teeth.</p>

<p>“I don’t like Pills,” grumbled he. “He’s a tightwad;
never even slipped me a cigar. He’s one o’
them fellers that stop the clock, nights, to save the
works. S’pose I’d oughta respect old age, but old age
ain’t always to be looked up to, as, fer instance, in the
case of eggs. He’s been ratin’ Master Hal down, I
reckon. An’ that wun’t <i>do</i>!”</p>

<p>Resentfully Ezra came back to the house and entered
the hall. Into the front room Ezra walked, approached
the fireplace and for a moment stood there,
carefully observing the weapons. Then he reached up
and straightened the position of the “Penang lawyer”
club, on its supporting hooks.</p>

<p>“I got to git that jest right,” said he. “Jest exactly
right. Ef the cap’n should see ’twas a mite
out o’ place he might suspicion that was what Master
Hal hit me with. So? Is that right, that way?”</p>

<p>With keen judgment he squinted at the club and gave
it a final touch. The kris, also, he adjusted.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Hal touched the toad-stabber, too,”
he remarked. “But I guess he must of. It’s been
moved some, that’s sure.</p>

<p>“I guess things’ll do now,” judged he, satisfied.
“There’s many a slip ’twixt the cup an’ the lip, but
there’s a damn sight more after the cup has been <i>at</i>
the lip. That’s all that made Master Hal slip. He
didn’t know, rightly, what he was up to. Forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the boy? God bless him, you bet! A million times
over!</p>

<p>“But that doctor, now, what’s been ratin’ Master
Hal down&mdash;no, no, he’ll never be no friend o’ <i>mine</i>!
Well, this ain’t gittin’ dinner ready fer Master Hal.
A boy what can dive off Geyser Rock, an’ lick McLaughlin,
an’ read heathen Chinee, an’ capture the
purtiest gal in <i>this</i> town, is goin’ to be rationed proper,
or I’m no cook aboard the snuggest craft that ever
sailed a lawn, with lilacs on the port bow an’ geraniums
to starb’d!”</p>

<p>Ezra gave a final, self-assuring glance at the Malay
club that had so nearly ended his life, and turned back
to his galley with a song upon his lips:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">
“A Yankee ship’s gone down the river,<br />
Her masts an’ yard they shine like silver.</p>

<p class="pph8 p1"><i>Blow, ye winds, I long to hear ye!<br />
Blow, boys, blow!</i></p>
<p class="pph8"><i>Blow to-day an’ blow to-morrer,<br />
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!</i></p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">How d’ye know she’s a Yankee clipper?<br />
By the Stars and Stripes that fly above her!</p>

<p class="pph8 p1"><i>Blow, boys, blow!</i></p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">An’ who d’ye think is captain of her?<br />
One-Eyed Kelly, the Bowery runner!</p>

<p class="pph8 p1"><i>Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!</i></p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">An’ what d’ye think they had fer dinner?<br />
Belayin’-pin soup an’ monkey’s liver!</p>

<p class="pph8 p1"><i>Blow, ye winds, I long to hear ye!<br />
Blow, boys, blow!</i></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">GEYSER ROCK</p>

<p>Hal Briggs had little thought of trouble as he strode
away in search of Laura. Very hot was his blood as
he swung down the shaded street toward the house of
Nathaniel Maynard, father of the girl. Some of the
good folk frowned and were silent as he greeted them,
but others had to smile and raise a hand of recognition.
Still at some distance from Laura’s house,
the boy caught sight of a creamy-toned voile dress
among the hollyhocks in the side yard. He whistled,
waved his hand, hurried his pace. And something
leaped within him, so that his heart beat up a little
thickly, as the girl waved an answering hand.</p>

<p>Another look came to his eyes. Another light began
to burn in their blue depths.</p>

<p>“Geyser Rock!” he whispered. “By God, the
very place!”</p>

<p class="p2">Geyser Rock boldly fronts the unbroken sweep of
the sea at Thunder Head. Up it leaps, sheer two
hundred feet, from great deeps. Fifty feet from the
barnacle-crusted line of high-tide a ledgelike path leads
to the face of the cliff. From this ledge Hal often
took the plunge that had won him local fame&mdash;a
plunge into frothing surf that even in the calmest of
midsummer days was never still.</p>

<p>Few visitors ever struggle up through sumacs, brakes
and undergrowth, to gain the vantage-point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
pinnacle. Rolling boulders, slippery ledge and dizzying
overlook upon the shining sea deter all but the
hardy. The very solitude of the place had greatly
endeared it to Hal. To him it was often a solace and
a comfort after his strange fits of rage and viciousness.</p>

<p>All alone, up in that isolated height, he had passed
long hours reading, smoking, musing in the tiny patch
of grass there under the canopy of the white-birches’
filigree of green, or under the huge pine that carpeted
the north slope of the crest with odorous, russet spills.
Some of his happiest hours had been spent on the
summit, through the tree-tops watching sky-shepherds
tend their flocks across the pastures infinitely far and
blue above him.</p>

<p>Strangely secluded was the top of Geyser Rock.
Though it lay hardly a pistol-shot from the main coast-road,
it seemed almost as isolated as if it had been
down among the Celebes.</p>

<p>For that reason Hal loved it best of all, with its
grasses, flowers, ferns and tangled thickets, its rock-ridges
filigreed with silvery lichens or sparkling with
white quartz-crystals. From this aerie Hal could
glimpse a bit of the village; the prim church spire;
the tiny, far gravestones sleeping on Croft Hill. The
solitude of this, his own domain by right of conquest,
had grown ever more dear and needful to him as he
had advanced toward manhood.</p>

<p>Such was the place toward which Laura and he
were now walking along the road, with tilled fields and
rock-bossed rolling hills to right of them; and, to
their left, the restless flashings of the sea.</p>

<p>Laura had never been more charming. Her happiness
in his return had flushed her cheeks with color
and had brightened her eyes&mdash;thoughtful, deep, loyal
eyes&mdash;till they looked clear and fresh as summer
skies after rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything wholesome and glad seemed joined in
Laura; her health and spirits were like the morning
breeze itself that came to court the land, from the
golden sparklings that stretched away to the shadowed,
purple rim of the ocean. The June within her heart
mirrored itself through her face, reflecting the June
that overbrooded earth and sea and sky.</p>

<p>Hal sensed all this and more, as with critical keenness
he looked down at her, walking beside him. He
noted the wind-blown hair that shaded her eyes; he
saw the health and vigor of that lithe, firm-breasted
young body of hers. His look, brooding, glowed
evilly. Fifty years ago thus had his grandsire’s eyes
kindled at sight of Kuala Pahang in her tight little
Malay jacket. And as if words from the past had
audibly echoed from some vibrant chord in the old-time
captain’s symphony of desire, once more the
thought formed in his brain:</p>

<p>“She’s mine, the girl is! She’s plump as a young
porpoise, and, by God, I’m going to have her!”</p>

<p>The words he uttered, though, were far afield from
these. He was saying:</p>

<p>“So now, Laura, you see I wasn’t really to blame,
after all. ‘A lie runs round the world, while truth
is getting on its sandals.’ That proverb’s as true here
as in Siam, where it originated. People are saying I
was drunk and brutal, and all that, when the fact is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, Hal,” she answered, her eyes troubled.
“I know how this country gossip exaggerates. But,
even so, did you do right in beating Captain McLaughlin
as you did?”</p>

<p>“It was the only thing I <i>could</i> do, Laura!” he protested.
“The bully tried to humiliate me. I&mdash;I just
licked him, that’s all. You wouldn’t want me to be a
milksop, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, not that, Hal. But a fair fight is one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and brutality is another. And then, too, they say
you’d been drinking.”</p>

<p>He laughed and slid his hand about her arm.</p>

<p>“I give you my word of honor, Laura, all I’d had
was just a little nip to take the sea-chill out of my
bones. Come, now, look at me, and tell me if I look
like a thug and a drunkard!”</p>

<p>He stopped in the deserted road, swung the girl
round toward him, and laid his hands on her shoulders.
Through the sheer thinness of her dress he felt
the warmth of her. The low-cut V of her waist
tempted him, dizzyingly, to plant a kiss there; but he
held steady, and met her questioning eyes with a look
that seemed all candor.</p>

<p>For a long moment Laura kept silence, searching
his face. Far off, mournfully the bell-buoy sent in
its blur of musical tolling across the moving sea-floor.</p>

<p>“Well, Laura, do I look a ruffian?” asked Hal
again, smiling.</p>

<p>Laura’s eyes fell.</p>

<p>“I’m going to believe you, Hal, whatever people
say,” she whispered. “I’m sorry it happened at all,
but I suppose that’s the way of a man. You won’t
do anything like that again, though, will you?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;dear! Never!”</p>

<p>He drew her toward him, but she shook her head
and pressed him back. Wise with understanding,
from sources of deep instinct, he let her go. But now
the fires in his eyes were burning more hotly. And
as they once more started down along the road he
cast on her a glance of quick and all-inclusive desire.</p>

<p>Silence a minute or two. Then Hal asked:</p>

<p>“Laura, have you ever been up Geyser Rock?”</p>

<p>“No. Why?” Her look was wondering.</p>

<p>“Let’s go!”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty rough climbing for a girl, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not for a girl like you, Laura. You can make
it, all right. And the view&mdash;oh, wonderful!” His
enthusiasm quickened now that he saw her coming to
his hand. “On a clear day you can see Cape Ann,
to northward, and Cross Rip Light, to the south.
See that big Norway pine right there? That’s where
the path leads in. Come on, Laura!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Afraid?”</p>

<p>“Not where <i>you</i> are, Hal, to protect me!”</p>

<p>He took her hand and drew her into the thick-wooded
path, in under the cool green shadows, gold-sprinkled
with the magic of the sun’s morris-dance
of little elfin light-fairies. New strength seemed to
flood him. His heart, beginning to beat quickly,
flushed his face with hot blood. Something as yet
unawakened, something potent, atavistic, something
that had its roots twined far into the past, surged
through his veins.</p>

<p>“Come on, Laura!” he repeated. “Come on, I’ll
show you the way!”</p>

<p class="p2">Half an hour had passed before they stood upon
the summit. They had perhaps lingered a bit more
than needful, even with so many leaves and flowers
to pick and study over; and, moreover, part of the
way their progress had been really difficult. Hal had
carried her in his arms up some of the more dangerous
pitches&mdash;carried her quite as if she had been a child.
The clinging of her arms to his shoulders, the warmth
and yielding of her, the blowing of her hair across
his face, the faint perfume of her alluring femininity
had kindled fires that glowed from his eyes&mdash;eyes
like the eyes of Alpheus Briggs in the old days when
the Malay girl had been his captive. Yet still the
atavisms in him had been stifled down. For Hal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
sober now. And still the metes and bounds of civilization
and of law had held the boy in leash.</p>

<p>Thus they had reached the summit. Far up past
the diving-ledge they had made their way, and so
had climbed to the little sheltered nook facing the sky.</p>

<p>“I think you’re wonderful, Laura!” Hal said as
he pressed aside the bushes for her to enter the grassy
sward. His voice was different now; his whole manner
had subtly altered. No longer words of college
argot came to his lips. “I think you’re really very
wonderful! There’s not another girl in this town
who’d take a risk like this!”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, Hal,” she answered, looking up at
him in the sunshine with a smile. “I told you before
I couldn’t possibly be afraid where you were. How
<i>could</i> I be afraid?”</p>

<p>“Lots of girls would be, all the same,” said he.
“You’re just a wonder. Well, now, let’s go over
there to the edge. I won’t let you fall. I want you
to see the view. Just through that fringe of birches
there you’ll see it.”</p>

<p>With quickened breath the girl peered down through
the trees, at land and sea spread far below, while Hal’s
arm held her from disaster. Branches and twigs had
pulled at her, in the ascent. Her voile dress showed
a tear or two; and all about her face the disordered
hair strayed as the sea-breeze freshened over the
top of Geyser. The boy kept silence that matched
hers. A kind of vague, half-realized struggle
seemed taking place in him&mdash;a conflict between the
sense of chivalry, protecting this woman in his absolute
power, and the old demon-clutch that reached from
other days and other places.</p>

<p>Now, though his thoughts and hers lay far apart
as the world’s poles, each felt something of the same
mysterious oppression. For the first time quite alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
together, up there aloft in that snug, sun-warm nest
embowered in greenery, a kind of mystic and half-sensed
languor seemed to envelop them; a yearning
that is older than old Egypt; a wonder and a dream.</p>

<p>Hal’s arm tightened a very little ’round her body.
She felt it tremble, and, wondering, understood that
she, too, felt a little of that tremor in her own heart.
She realized in a kind of half-sensed way that more
dangers lay here than the danger of falling from the
cliff. Yet in her soul she knew that she was glad to
be there.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">LAURA UNDERSTANDS</p>

<p>Thus she remained, holding to a silver birch, leaning
out a little toward the chasm. Up from the depths
echoed a gurgling roar as the white fury drenched
and belabored the gray, sheer wall, then fell back,
hissing.</p>

<p>For a moment Laura peered down, held by the boy’s
encircling arm. She looked abroad upon the sun-shining
waters flecked with far, white boats and
smudged with steamer-smoke. Then she breathed
deep and lifted up her face toward the gold filigree
of sun and leaf, and sighed:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s wonderful, Hal! I never even guessed
it could be anything like this!”</p>

<p>“Wonderful isn’t the name for it, Laura,” he answered.
He pointed far. “See the lighthouse?
And Cape Ann in the haze? And the toy boats?
Everything and everybody’s a toy now except just
you and me. We’re the only real people. I wish it
were really so, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, Hal? What would you do if it were?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he answered with that heart-warming smile
of his, “I’d take you in a yacht, Laura, away off to
some of those wonderful places the Oriental poems
tell about. We’d sail away ‘through the Silken Sea,’
and ‘Beyond the Wind,’ wherever that is. Wouldn’t
you like to go there with me, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But what, Laura?” His lips were almost brushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the curve of her neck, where the wind-blown hair
fell in loose ringlets. “But what?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I mustn’t answer that, Hal. Not now!”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>“While you’re still in college, Hal? While there’s
so much work and struggle still ahead of you?”</p>

<p>The boy frowned, unseen by her, for her eyes were
fixed on the vague horizons beyond which, no doubt,
lay Silken Seas and far, unknown places of enchantment
beyond all winds whatsoever. Not thus did he
desire to be understood by Laura. The whim of June
shrinks from being mistaken for a thing of lifelong
import. Laura drew back from the chasm and faced
him with a little smile.</p>

<p>“It’s very wrong for people to make light of such
things,” she said. Her look lay steadily upon his face.
“While the sun is shining it’s so easy to say more
than one means. And then, at the first cloud, the
fancy dies like sunlight fading.”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t a mere fancy that I feel for you,”
Hal persisted, sensing that he had lost ground with
her. “I’ve had plenty of foolish ideas about girls.
But this is different. It’s so very, very different every
way!” His voice, that he well knew how to make
convincing, really trembled a little with the thrill of
this adventuring.</p>

<p>“I wish I could believe you, Hal!”</p>

<p>He drew her toward him again. This time she did
not resist. He felt the yielding of her sinuous young
body, its warmth and promise of intoxication.</p>

<p>“You <i>can</i> believe me, Laura! Only trust in me!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know, Hal. I know what men are.
They’re all so much alike.”</p>

<p>“Not all, dear! You ought to know me well
enough to have confidence in me. Think of the long,
long time we’ve known each other. Think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
years and years of friendship! Why, Laura, we’ve
known each other ever since we were a couple of children
playing on the beach, writing each other’s names
in the sand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For the next high tide to wash away!”</p>

<p>“But we’re not children now. There’s something
in my heart no tide can obliterate!”</p>

<p>“I hope that’s true, Hal. But you’re not through
college yet. Wait till you are. You’ve got to graduate
with flying colors, and make your dear old grandfather
the proudest man in the world, and be the
wonderful success I know you’re going to be! And
make me the happiest girl! You will, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything in the world for you, Laura!”
he exclaimed. His face, flushed with enkindling desire,
showed no sign of shame or dejection. Laura knew
nothing of his débâcle at the university. Of course
she must soon know; but all that still lay in the future.
And to Hal nothing mattered now but just the golden
present with its nectar in the blossom and its sunshine
on the leaf. He drew her a little closer.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he whispered. “Do you really care?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me&mdash;yet!” she denied him, turning
her face away. “Come, let’s be going down!”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ve only just come!”</p>

<p>“I know, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of <i>me</i>!” he exclaimed.
“You aren’t, are you, dear?”</p>

<p>“No more than I am of myself,” she answered
frankly, while her throat and face warmed with blood
that suddenly burned there. “We&mdash;really oughtn’t
to be alone like this, Hal.”</p>

<p>He laughed and opened his arms to let her go. For
a moment she stood looking up at him; then her eyes,
too innocent to find the guile in his, smiled with pure-hearted
affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Forgive me, Hal!” said she. “I didn’t mean that.
But, you know, when you put your arms round me like
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it again,” he answered, instinct telling
him the bird would take fright if the trap seemed too
tightly closed. He dropped his arms, the palms of
his hands spread outward. “You see, when you tell
me to let you go, I mind you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, like the good, dear boy you are!” she exclaimed
with sudden, impulsive affection. She reached
up, took his face in both hands and studied his eyes.
He thought she was about to kiss him, and his heart
leaped. He quivered to seize her, to burn his kisses
on her lips, there in the leafy, sun-glimmering shade;
but already Laura’s arms had fallen, and she had
turned away, back toward the path that would lead
them downward from this tiny enchanted garden to
the common level of the world again.</p>

<p>“Come, Hal,” said she, “we must be going now!”</p>

<p>He nodded, his eyes glowering coals of desire, and
followed after. Was the bird, then, going to escape
his hand? A sinister look darkened his face; just
such a look as had made Captain Briggs a brute when
he had shouldered his way into his cabin aboard the
<i>Silver Fleece</i>, to master the captive girl.</p>

<p>“Laura, wait a minute, please!” begged Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” she asked, half-turning, a
beautiful, white, gracious figure in the greenery&mdash;a
very wood-nymph of a figure, sylvan, fresh, enwoven
with life’s most mystic spell&mdash;the magic of youth.</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen half my little Mysterious Island
up here!”</p>

<p>“Mysterious Island?” asked she, pleased by the
fanciful whim. “You call it that, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve always called it that ever since I read
Jules Verne, when I was only a youngster. I’ve never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
told anybody, though. I haven’t told that, or a hundred
other imaginings.” He had come close to her
again, had taken her by the arm, was drawing her
away from the path and toward the little flower-enameled
greensward among the boulders crowned
with birch and pine. “You’re the only one that knows
my secret, Laura. You’ll never, never tell, now, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Never!” she answered, uneasiness dispelled by his
frank air. “Do you imagine things like that, too,
Hal? I thought I was the only one around here who
ever ‘pretended.’ Are you a dreamer, too?”</p>

<p>“Very much a dreamer. Sit down here, Laura,
and let me tell you some of my dreams.”</p>

<p>He sat down in the grass, and drew her down beside
him. She yielded “half willing and half shy.” For
a moment he looked at her with eyes of desire. Then,
still holding her hand, he said:</p>

<p>“It was all fairies and gnomes up here when I first
came. Fairyland in those boyhood days. After a
while the fairies went away and pirates began to come;
pirates and Indians and a wild crew. I was sometimes
a victim, sometimes a member of the brotherhood.
There’s treasure buried all ’round here. Those were
the days when I was reading about Captain Kidd and
Blackbeard. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I <i>do</i>! Go on!”</p>

<p>He laughed, as her mood yielded under the subtle
mastery of his voice, his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s a motley crew we’ve been up here,
the pirates and I!” said he, leaning still closer.
“‘Treasure Island’ peopled the place with adventurers&mdash;Long
John Silver, and Pew and the Doctor,
and all the rest. ‘Robinson Crusoe’ swept them all
away, all but Man Friday; and then the savages had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to come. If there’s anything at all I haven’t suffered
in the way of shipwreck, starvation, cannibals and
being rescued just in the nick of time up here, really
I don’t know what it is. And since I’ve grown up,
though of course I can’t ‘pretend’ any more, I’ve
always loved this place to day-dream in, and wonder
in, about the thing that every man hopes will come
to him some day.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that, Hal?” she asked in a lower
voice.</p>

<p>“Love!” he whispered. “Love&mdash;and you!”</p>

<p>“Hal, is that really true?”</p>

<p>“Look at me, Laura, and you’ll know!”</p>

<p>She could not meet his gaze. Her eyes lowered.
He drew his arm about her as she drooped a little
toward him.</p>

<p>“Listen to me!” he commanded, masterfully lying.
“There’s never been anybody but you, Laura. There
never will be. You’ve been in all my dreams, by night,
my visions by day, up here in fairyland!”</p>

<p>His words were coming impetuously now. In his
eyes the golden flame of desire was burning hot.</p>

<p>“You’re everything to me! Everything! I’ve
sensed it for a long time, but only in the last month
or two I’ve really understood. It all came to me in
a kind of revelation, Laura, one day when I was
translating a poem from the Hindustani.”</p>

<p>“A poem, Hal?” The girl’s voice was tremulous.
Her eyes had closed. Her head, resting on his shoulder,
thrilled him with ardor; and in his nostrils the
perfume of her womanhood conjured up shimmering
dream-pictures of the Orient&mdash;strange lands that,
though unseen, he mysteriously seemed to know.
“Tell me the poem, dear!” Laura whispered. “A
love-poem?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Such a love-poem! Listen, sweetheart! It’s a
thousand years old, and it comes from the dim past to
tell you what I feel for you. It runs this way:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Belovèd, were I to name the blossoms of the spring,<br />
And all the fruits of autumn’s bounteousness;<br />
Were I to name all things that charm and thrill,<br />
And earth, and Heaven, all in one word divine,</p>
<p class="pph8">I would name thee!</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Had I the gold of Punjab’s golden land,<br />
Had I as many diamonds, shining bright<br />
As leaves that tremble in a thousand woods,<br />
Or sands along ten thousand shining seas;<br />
Had I as many pearls of shifting hue<br />
As blades of grass in fields of the whole world,<br />
Or stars that shine on the broad breast of night,<br />
I’d give them all, a thousand, thousand times,</p>
<p class="pph8">To make thee mine!”</p>

<p class="p1">For a minute, while Hal watched her with calculation,
Laura kept silence. Then she looked up at him,
dreamy-eyed, and smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s wonderful, Hal. I only wish you meant
it!”</p>

<p>“You <i>know</i> I do! I want you, Laura&mdash;God, how
much! You’re all I need to make my fairyland up
here a heaven!”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what do you mean, Hal? Are you asking
me to&mdash;to be your wife?”</p>

<p>His face contracted, involuntarily, but he veiled his
true thought with a lie. What mattered just a lie to
gain possession of her in this golden hour of sunshine?</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course!” he cried, drawing her to
his lips in a betraying kiss&mdash;a kiss, to her, culminant
with wonder and mystic with a good woman’s aspiration
for a life of love and service&mdash;a kiss, to him,
only a trivial incident, lawless, unbridled. At heart he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
cursed the girl’s pure passion for him. Not this was
what he wanted; and dimly, even through the flame
of his desire, he could see a hundred complications,
perils. But now the lie was spoken&mdash;and away with
to-morrow!</p>

<p>Again he kissed the girl, sensing, in spite of his
desire, the different quality of her returning kiss.
Then she smiled up at him, and with her hand smoothed
back the thick, black hair from his forehead.</p>

<p>“It’s all so wonderful, Hal!” she whispered fondly.
“I can’t believe it’s true. But it is true, isn’t it?
Even though we’ve got to wait till you get through
college. I’m willing to. I love you enough, Hal, to
wait forever. And you will, too, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of&mdash;of course I will!”</p>

<p>“And it’s really, really true? It’s not just a fairy
dream of wonderland, up here, that will vanish when
we go down to the world again?”</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s all true, Laura,” he was forced to answer,
baffled and at a loss. Not at all was this adventure
developing as he had planned it. Why, Laura
was taking it seriously! Laura was acting like a
child&mdash;a foolish, preposterous child! The web that
he had hoped to spread for her undoing had, because
of her own trusting confidence, been tangled all about
himself.</p>

<p>Abashed and angry, he sought some way to break
its bonds. Another poem rose to memory, a poem
that he hoped might make her understand. He had
read it the day before in a little book called “The
Divine Image,” and it had instantly burned itself into
his brain. Now said he:</p>

<p>“Listen, dear. I’ve got another verse for you.
It’s called: ‘His Woman.’”</p>

<p>“And I’m really yours, forever?”</p>

<p>“Of course you are, dear! Listen, now:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p class="pphq6 p1">“‘In the pale, murmuring dawn she lay<br />
Alone, with nothing more to lose.</p>
<p class="ppn6">Her eyes one warm, soft arm espied,</p>
<p class="pph6">And lips too tired to voice her pride<br />
Caressed and kissed a bruise.’”</p>

<p class="p1">The girl looked up at him a moment, circled with
his arm, as she lay there content. For a little she
seemed not to understand. Then, slowly, a puzzled
look and then a look of hurt rose to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Hal, you&mdash;you mustn’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why mustn’t I, dear?”</p>

<p>She tried to answer, but his lips upon her mouth
stifled her speech.</p>

<p>Swift fear leaped through her as she fought away
from him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hal!” she cried. “What&mdash;what are you
looking at me that way for? Your eyes, Hal&mdash;your
eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p>In vain he tried to kiss her. Her face was turned
away, her hands repulsing him.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Laura! Kiss me!”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;not now! Oh, Hal, you have only yourself
to resist. I have you to resist, and myself, too!”</p>

<p>The thought gave him a minute’s pause. Did some
instinct of chivalry, deep-buried, try for a second to
struggle up through his evil heritage, or was it but
surprise that loosed his grip upon her so that she escaped
his hands, his arms?</p>

<p>“God forgive you, Hal, for having killed the most
wonderful treasure I had&mdash;my faith in you!” she
cried from where she stood now, looking down at him
with tragic eyes of disillusion. “Oh, God forgive
you!”</p>

<p>He would have spoken, but she turned and fled
toward the tangled thicket through which the path led
downward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Laura! Wait!” He sprang to his feet, peering
after her with hateful eyes. No answer as she
vanished through the greenery.</p>

<p>For all his rage and passion, Hal realized how absurd
a figure he would make, pursuing her. Swift
anger swept over him, broke all down, rushed in uncontrolled
floods.</p>

<p>A moment he stood there, brutal, venomous. Then
with a laugh, the echo of that which had sounded when
Alpheus Briggs had flung the Malay girl to death, he
clutched at his thick hair, tugging at it with excess of
madness. He broke into wild curses that rose against
the sky with barbarous blasphemy.</p>

<p>Foam slavered upon his lips. His face grew black;
the veins stood out upon his neck and temples. A
madman, he trampled through the bushes, stamping,
striking, lusting to kill.</p>

<p>So for a time he raged in blind, stark passion; while
Laura, shaken and afraid, bleeding at her heart of
hearts, made her way all alone back to the safety of
the seashore road.</p>

<p>At last, his rage burned out, Hal flung himself down
in the grass. Face buried in hands, teeth set in bleeding
lip, he lay there.</p>

<p>And over him the heavens, like an eyeless face,
smiled down with calm, untroubled purpose.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</p>

<p>Sadly returning home, Laura stopped for a moment
at her garden gate to make quite sure her father was
not in the side yard. With all her girlish dreams
broken and draggled, the heartbroken girl stood looking
at the flowers that only an hour before had seemed
so wondrous gay. And all at once she heard the sound
of wheels upon the road. Turning, she saw old Captain
Briggs and Dr. Filhiol slowly driving toward
Snug Haven.</p>

<p>Half-minded to retreat inside the garden, still she
stood there, for already Captain Briggs had raised a
hand in greeting. Every feature of the old captain’s
face was limned with grief. His shoulders seemed to
sag, bowed down with heavier weight than his almost
eighty years could pile upon them.</p>

<p>So the girl remained at the gate, greatly sorrowing;
and peered after the two old men. Though she could
not guess the captain’s trouble, her woman’s instinct
told her this trouble bore on Hal. And over her own
grief settled still another cloud that darkened it still
more.</p>

<p>Puzzled, disillusioned, she swung the gate and entered
the prim paths bordered with low box-hedges.
No one saw her. Quietly she entered the house and
crept up-stairs to her own room. There, in that virginal
place, she dropped down on her old-fashioned,
four-posted bed of black walnut, and buried her face in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the same pillows to which, girl-like, she had often confided
so many innocent and tender dreams.</p>

<p>As the girl lay there, crying for the broken bauble,
love, crushed in the brutal hand of Hal, old Captain
Briggs and Dr. Filhiol&mdash;once more back on the quarterdeck
of Snug Haven&mdash;settled themselves for dejected
consultation.</p>

<p>“I never did expect ’twould be as much as that,” the
captain said, mechanically stuffing his pipe. “I reckoned
maybe fifty dollars would pay demurrage and repairs
on Mac. McLaughlin isn’t worth more, rig and
all. But, Judas priest, two hundred and a half!
That’s running into money. Money I can ill afford
to pay, sir!”</p>

<p>“I know,” the doctor answered. “It’s cruel extortion.
But what can you do, captain? McLaughlin
holds the tiller now. He can steer any course he
chooses. The fact that he started at five hundred, plus
the apology that he demands from Hal on the deck of
the <i>Sylvia</i> in front of the whole crew, and that we’ve
pared him down to two hundred and fifty, plus the
apology&mdash;that’s a very great gain. It’s bad, I know,
but not so bad as having had the boy locked up, charged
with felonious assault. It’s not so bad as that, sir!”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not,” Briggs agreed. “I suppose
I’ve got to pay, though Lord knows, sir, the
money’s needed terribly for other things, now that
the college bill has got to be settled all over again!”</p>

<p>“I know it’s hard,” sympathized the doctor, “but
there’s no help for it. Wipe the slate clean, and give
Hal another start. That’s all you <i>can</i> do.”</p>

<p>The old captain remained smoking and brooding a
while, with sunshine on his head. At last his eyes
sought the far, deep line of blue that stretched against
the horizon&mdash;the sea-line, lacking which the old man
always sensed a vacancy, a loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Close on to six bells,” judged he, “by the way the
sun’s shining on the water. Wonder where the boy
can be? I’ve got to have a proper gam with him.”</p>

<p>“Why? Where ought he to be?” the doctor asked.</p>

<p>“He must have put back into port, after his little
cruise with Laura, this morning. We sighted her,
moored at her front gate, you remember?”</p>

<p>“H-m! You don’t suppose there’s trouble brewing
there too, do you? I thought the girl looked upset,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> didn’t notice anything. What seemed to be the
matter?”</p>

<p>“I thought she’d been crying a bit.”</p>

<p>The captain clenched his fist.</p>

<p>“By the Judas priest!” he exclaimed fervently.
“If I thought Hal had been abusing that girl, I’d
make it hot for him! That’s <i>one</i> thing I won’t stand!”
He peered down the road with narrowing eyes, then
got up and went to the front door. “Hal, oh, Hal!”
he cried.</p>

<p>No answer. The captain’s voice echoed emptily in
the old-fashioned hallway.</p>

<p>“Not here, anyhow,” said he, returning to his
rocker. “Well, we won’t accuse him of anything else
till we know. I only hope he hasn’t written any more
black pages on the log by mishandling Laura.”</p>

<p>Wearily his eyes sought Croft Hill. Of a sudden
unbidden tears blurred his sight.</p>

<p>“<i>There’s</i> a peaceful harbor for old, battered craft,
anyhow,” he murmured, pointing. “I sometimes envy
all the tired folk that’s found sleep and rest up there in
their snug berths, while we still stand watch in all
weathers. If, after all I’ve worked and hoped for,
there’s nothing ahead but breakers, I’ll envy them more
than ever.”</p>

<p>“Come now, captain!” Filhiol tried to cheer him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
“Maybe it was only a little lovers’ quarrel that sent
Laura home. There’s never all smooth sailing, with
maid and man for a crew. Let’s wait a while and
see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, wait and think it over,” said the captain.
“There’s only one place for me, doctor, when things
look squally, and that’s with my folks on the hill.
Guess I’ll take a walk up there now and talk it over
with them. Come with me, will you?”</p>

<p>Filhiol shook his head.</p>

<p>“Too much for me, that hill is,” he answered. “If
you don’t mind, I’ll sit right here and watch the sea.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself, doctor.” And Captain Briggs
arose. “When Ezra comes down the lane tell him not
to bother with dinner. A little snack will do. Let’s
each of us think this thing out, and maybe we can chart
the proper course between us.”</p>

<p>He stood a moment in the sunshine, then, bare-headed,
went down the steps and turned into the path
that would lead him up Croft Hill. He stopped, gathering
a handful of bright flowers&mdash;zinnias, hollyhocks,
sweet peas&mdash;for his ever-remembered dead.
Then he went on again.</p>

<p>“Poor old chap!” said Dr. Filhiol. “The curse is
biting pretty deep. That’s all poppycock, that Malay
cursing; but the curses of heredity are stern reality.
There’s a specific for every poison in the world. Even
the dread <i>curaré</i> has one. But for the poison of
heredity, what remedy is there? Poor old captain!”</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs, with bowed head, climbed up the
winding way among the blackberry bushes, the sumacs
and wild roses dainty-sweet; and so at last came to
the wall pierced with the whitewashed gate that he
himself kept always in repair.</p>

<p>Into the cemetery, his Garden of Gethsemane, he
penetrated, by paths flanked with simple and pious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
stones, many of hard slate carved with death’s-heads,
urns, cherubs and weeping-willows, according to the
custom of the ancient, godly days. Thus to his family
burial lot he came, and there laid his offering upon the
graves he loved; and then sat down upon the bench
there, for meditation in this hour of sorrow and perplexity.</p>

<p>And as sun and sky and sea, fresh breeze and drifting
cloud, and the mild influences of his lifelong friend,
tobacco, all worked their soothings on him, he presently
plucked up a little heart once more. The nearness
of his dead bade him have hope and courage. He
felt, in that quiet and solemn place, the tightening of
his family bonds; he felt that duty called him to lift
even these new and heavy burdens, to bear them
valiantly and like a man.</p>

<p>With the graves about him and the sea before, and
over all the heavens, calm returned. And sorrow&mdash;which,
like anger, cannot long be keen&mdash;faded into
another thought: the thought of how he should make
of Hal the man that he would have him be.</p>

<p>How restful was this sunlit hilltop, where he knew
that soon he, too, must sleep! The faint, far cries of
gulls drifted in to him with the bell-buoy’s slow tolling;
and up from the village rose the music of the smitten
anvil. That music minded him of a Hindustani poem
Hal once had read to him&mdash;a poem about the blacksmith,
Destiny, beating out showers of sparks upon the
cosmic anvil in the night of eternity, each spark a
human soul; and each, swiftly extinguished, worth just
as much to Destiny as earthly anvil sparks are to the
human toiler at the forge&mdash;as much and no more.</p>

<p>The poem had thus ended:</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“All is Maya, all is illusion! Why struggle, then?<br />
To walk is better than to run; to stand is better than to walk.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>To sit is better than to stand; to lie is better than to sit.<br />
To sleep is better than to wake; to dream is better than to live.<br />
Better still is a sleep that is dreamless,</p>
<p class="ppn6">And death is best of all!”</p>

<p class="p1">“I wonder if that’s true?” the captain mused.
“I wonder if life <i>is</i> all illusion and death alone is real?”</p>

<p>Thus meditating, he felt very near the wife and son
who lay there beneath the flowers he had just laid on
the close-cut sod. The cloud-shadows, drifting over
the hilltop, seemed symbols of the transitory passage of
man’s life, unstable, ever drifting on, and leaving on
the universe no greater imprint than shadows on the
grass. He yearned toward those who had gone to
rest before him; and though not a praying man, a supplication
voiced itself in him:</p>

<p>“Oh, God, let me finish out my work, and let me
rest! Let me put the boy on the right course through
life, and let me know he’ll follow it&mdash;then, let me
steer for the calm harbor where Thou, my Pilot, wilt
give me quiet from the storm!”</p>

<p>Thus the old captain sat there for a long time, pondering
many and sad things; and all at once he saw the
figure of a man in white coming along the road. The
captain knew him afar.</p>

<p>“There’s Hal now,” said he. “I wonder where
he’s been and what this all means?”</p>

<p>A new anxiety trembled through his wounded heart,
that longed for nothing now but love and trust. Up
rose the old captain, and with slow steps walked to the
eastern wall of the cemetery. There he waited patiently.</p>

<p>Presently Hal came into sight, round the shoulder
of Croft Hill.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, there! Hal! Come here&mdash;I want to see
you!”</p>

<p>The old man’s cry dropped with disagreeable surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
into Hal’s sinister reflections. Hal looked up, and
swore to himself. He sensed the meaning of that
summons.</p>

<p>“There’s another damned scene coming,” thought
Hal. “Why the hell can’t he let me alone now?
Why can’t everybody let me alone?”</p>

<p>Nothing could now have been more inopportune than
an interview with his grandfather. Hal&mdash;his rage
burned out to ashes&mdash;had come down from Geyser
Rock, and had turned homeward in evil humor. And
as he had gone he had already begun to lay out tentative
plans for what he meant to do.</p>

<p>“It’s all bull, what Laura handed me!” he had been
thinking when the captain’s summons had intruded.
“Am I going to let her throw me that way? I guess
<i>not</i>! I’ll land her yet; but not here, not here! I can’t
stick here. The way I’m in wrong with the college, and
now this new rough-house with Laura, will certainly
put the crimp in me. What I’ve got to do is clear out.
And I won’t go alone, at that. If I only had a twenty-five
footer! I could get her aboard of it some way.
The main thing’s a boat. The rest is easy. I could
let them whistle, all of them. The open sea&mdash;that’s
the thing! That’s a man’s way to do things&mdash;not go
sniveling ’round here in white flannels all summer,
letting a girl hand it to me that way!</p>

<p>“God, if I could only raise five hundred bucks! I
could get Jim Gordon’s <i>Kittiwink</i> for that, and provision
it, too. Make a break for Cuba, or Honduras;
why, damn it, I could go round the world&mdash;go East&mdash;get
away from all this preaching and rough-house&mdash;live
like a man, by God!”</p>

<p>The captain’s hail shattered Hal’s dreams.</p>

<p>“Devil take the old man!” snarled Hal to himself as
he scowled up at the figure on the hilltop. “What’s he
want <i>now</i>? And devil take all women! They’re like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
dogs. Beat a dog and a woman, and you can’t go
wrong. I’ll play this game to win yet, and make good!
Hello, up there?” he shouted in reply to the captain.
“What d’you want of me?”</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you, Hal,” the old man’s voice
came echoing down. “Come here, sir!”</p>

<p>Another moment Hal hesitated. Then, realizing
that he could not yet raise the banner of open rebellion,
he turned and lagged toward the road that led up
the south side of the hill.</p>

<p>As he climbed, he put into the background of his
brain the plans he had been formulating, and for the
more pressing need of the future began framing plausible
lies.</p>

<p>He lighted a Turkish cigarette as he entered the
graveyard, to give himself a certain nonchalance; and
so, smoking this thing which the old captain particularly
abominated, swinging his shoulders, he came
along the graveled walk toward the family burying
lot, where once more Captain Briggs had sat down
upon the bench to wait for him.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="pch">HIS WORD OF HONOR</p>

<p>The old man said nothing at all, as Hal drew near,
but only peered at him from under those white-thatched
brows of his, with eyes of stern reproach. This still
further quickened Hal’s apprehension and blew to a
kindling fire the glowing embers of venomous ill-humor.</p>

<p>For all his swagger, Hal could not bring himself to
look the captain in the eye. Hands in pockets, cigarette
in lips, he came close and stood there; and with
defiant surliness on his tanned face managed to say:</p>

<p>“Well, gramp, what now? Getting ready to pan me
properly, are you? If so, when ready, Gridley, you
can fire!”</p>

<p>“Hal,” answered the old man, “that’s the last impertinence
you’re ever going to utter to me! So remember.
Sit down and answer my questions.”</p>

<p>“I can take it standing, all right!” said Hal, defiant
still.</p>

<p>“I said, sit down, sir!”</p>

<p>Making no answer this time, the boy hulked his
surly way toward the ancient, flat-topped tomb, the
granite slab of which&mdash;supported on six stone pillars&mdash;bore
the name “Amalfi Briggs.”</p>

<p>“Not there, sir!” exclaimed the captain sternly.
“Have you no respect for either dead or living? Here
on this bench beside me! Sit down, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Hal slouched down beside his grandfather, his huge
shoulders sagging. A strange resemblance grew visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
between these two&mdash;young man and old; black-haired
and white.</p>

<p>“Well, now what is it?” demanded Hal with an
oblique glance.</p>

<p>“The first thing, sir, is that I’m going to be obeyed,
without question and without any back talk. I never
took it aboard my ships, and I’m not going to stand
any impertinence. I’m an old man, but I’m still captain
of Snug Harbor. As long as there’s a breath of
air in my lungs or a drop of blood in my veins, I’m
going to give orders there; and those that don’t like
them will have to sail with some other skipper. Do
you understand <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the boy, more subdued in tone.
This new note of his grandfather’s told him real business
was up-wind.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. That’s understood,” continued
Alpheus, grimly. “You are subordinate to me. That
point ought never to have been raised at all, and with a
right-minded grandson it never would have been. But
since you’ve shown yourself rebellious, it’s got to be.
I’m master, and you’re man. Don’t ever forget that,
sir. If you do, into the small boat you go, and away;
and, once you’ve gone, there’s no Jacob’s-ladder down
the side for you ever again!”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. What next?”</p>

<p>“Next, throw away that infernal cigarette, sir.
There’ll be no cigarettes smoked here in presence of our
dead!”</p>

<p>“But, gramp, you’ve been smoking that rank old
pipe here!”</p>

<p>The cigarette, dashed from Hal’s mouth, would
have burned a hole in the white flannel trousers had
not Hal swiftly brushed its fire away. Hal’s eyes
glowered with swift anger, but he held his tongue.
The captain began again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where have you been, sir?”</p>

<p>“Been? Why&mdash;nowhere&mdash;just taking a walk
with Laura. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“H-m! Why didn’t you come back with her?”</p>

<p>“She&mdash;got mad at something, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hal’s face grew ugly. With savage eyes he regarded
the old man.</p>

<p>“Mad at what? What did you say to her?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, gramp, so help me! She got jealous
about another girl in Boston, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. I hope that <i>is</i> all. If you’ve been
lying to me, or if you’ve hurt one hair of that girl’s
head, it’ll be a bad day for you, sir! Now then, listen
to me! You’ve got me into shoal waters, on a lee
shore, with your evil ways. Yes, and you’ve got
yourself there, too. I’ve been to see Squire Bean this
morning, on account of your assault on Fergus McLaughlin.”</p>

<p>“Assault, nothing! That was a fair fight, and I
trimmed him.”</p>

<p>“Legally, it’s assault and battery. Do you know
how much it’s going to cost me to keep you out of court
and clear the name of Briggs? Cash money, sir.
Money that would have been yours later, but that I’ve
got to take out of my safe now because of your evil
doings?”</p>

<p>“Out of the safe?” asked Hal, his thoughts diverted
into a new channel. He was going to add: “I thought
you kept your money in the Endicutt National.” But
he nipped the words before they could escape him.
The captain, too wrought up to notice the gleam in his
grandson’s eyes or the evil portent of the question, repeated:</p>

<p>“Do you know how much it’s going to cost me,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Search <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty dollars, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding!”</p>

<p>“That will do, sir, for that kind of language in hearing
of our family dead!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, gramp&mdash;I forgot myself!” Hal
apologized, feigning contrition. “You don’t mean to
tell me McLaughlin has the nerve to ask that much&mdash;and
can collect it?”</p>

<p>“He asked five hundred, but Dr. Filhiol’s help reduced
the claim. I’ve agreed to pay. That’s a hard
blow to me, Hal, but there’s far worse. I got a letter
from the college this morning that carried away all
canvas. It brought me heavy, bad news, Hal!”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Hal moodily, his eyes fixed on
the close-trimmed grass. “It was bound to come!
I’m fired from college!”</p>

<p>“And yet you went gallivanting off with Laura,
and never even reported it to me!”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d find it out soon enough. Yes, I’m on
the shelf with the rest of the canned goods!”</p>

<p>“Dishonorably discharged from the service, sir!
And for what cause?”</p>

<p>“How do <i>I</i> know what that sour old pill, Travers,
has framed up on me?” demanded Hal angrily.
“He’s the kind of guy that would make murder out of
killing a mosquito. If a fellow takes a single drink, or
looks at a skirt&mdash;a girl, I mean&mdash;he’s ready to chop
his head off!”</p>

<p>“Is, eh?” demanded the old captain sternly. “So
you deny having been drunk and disorderly, having
committed an assault on a proctor, having stolen the
money I sent you for your bill, and having cheated in
examinations? Here in this place of solemn memories
you deny all that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;” Hal began, but the tale of his misdemeanors
was too circumstantial for even his brazen
effrontery.</p>

<p>“You deny it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use, gramp?” Hal angrily flung at
him. “Everything’s framed up against me! I’m
sick of the whole thing, anyhow. College is a frost.
I never fell for it at all. You tried to wish it on me,
when everything I wanted in the world was to go to
sea. It’s all true. Let it go at that!”</p>

<p>“So then, sir, I still have a heavy bill at college to
pay, besides the disgrace of your discharge?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so! I’m fired. Glad I <i>am</i>! Glad
I’m done with the whole damned business!”</p>

<p>“Sir! Mind your tongue!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, I tell you!” The boy’s face seemed
burning with interior fires, suddenly enkindled. “I
quit everything. Give me a boat, gramp&mdash;anything
that’ll sail&mdash;a twenty-five footer, and let me go! I
don’t ask you for a dollar. All I ask is a boat. Give
me that, and I swear to God I’ll never trouble you
again!”</p>

<p>“A boat, Hal? What do you mean, sir?”
Startled, the captain peered at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” Hal cried with sudden passion. “A
boat&mdash;that’s all I want now! I’m dying here! I was
dying in college, choking to death by inches!” He
stood up, raised his head, and flung his arms towards
the sea. He cried from his black heart’s depths:</p>

<p>“Let me go! Oh, let me go, let me go!”</p>

<p>“Go? Go where?”</p>

<p>“Lord, how do <i>I</i> know? All I want is to go somewhere,
away from here. This place is cursed! I’m
cursed here, and so are you, as long as I’m around!”</p>

<p>“Cursed, Hal?” whispered the captain, tensely.
“What gives you that idea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know it! This village bounded on one side by
nothing and on the other by a graveyard&mdash;I can’t
stand it, and I won’t! Let me go somewhere, anywhere,
out to sea, where it’s calling me out over beyond
<i>there</i>!” He gestured mightily at the lure of the
horizon. “Let me go out past the Silken Sea, beyond
the Back of the Wind!”</p>

<p>Panting a little he grew silent, with clenched fists,
face flushed and veins swollen on neck and brow. The
old man, staring, shivered at sound of the strange
Malay words, now suddenly spoken again after half a
century&mdash;words that echoed ghostlike in the empty
chambers of the past. He peered at Hal, as at an apparition.
His face, pale under its weather-beaten tan,
drew into lines of anguish.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” the boy flung at him again. “You’ve
got to let me go!”</p>

<p>“Sit down, sir!” the captain made shift to answer.
“This is sheer lunacy. What, sir? You want to
give up your career, your family, everything? You
want to take a small boat and go sailing off into nowhere?
Why, sir, Danvers Asylum is the place for
you. No more such talk, sir; not another word!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you say, I’m going, anyhow,”
Hal defied him. “I’m not going to rot in this dump.
It’s no place for a live man, and you know it!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got no money to be buying boats, Hal!
No, nor no skipper’s papers, either. By the Judas
priest, sir, but you’re crazy! You’ll be talking piracy
next, or some such nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what I talk,” the boy retorted. “I’m
sick of this! I’m through! I’m going to live, and be
myself, and be&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll be a corpse or a jail-bird, if that’s the
course you’re sailing!” the captain cut in. “This is
a civilized world you’re living in now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Civilized! My God, civilized! That’s all I hear&mdash;civilized!
When you were my age were <i>you</i> always
civilized? Were <i>you</i> kept on dry land instead of going
to sea? Were <i>you</i> buried in college, learning
damned, dry rubbish?”</p>

<p>“Dry rubbish? Your Oriental studies dry rubbish?”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to go to college for those! What you
know of the East, did you learn it out of books? You
did not! You learned it out of life! Learned it yourself,
‘somewhere east of Suez.’ Well, the temple-bells
are calling me, too; and yet you pen me up in this
crabbed little New England village, where they don’t
even know there <i>are</i> temple-bells! It’s choking me to
death, I tell you!” He caught at his throat, as if
striving for air. “But you don’t understand. You’re
old now, and you’ve ‘put it all behind you, long ago
and far away,’ and now you ask me to be civilized!”</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me, sir,” the captain asked, his
voice trembling, “that you’d abandon me, after the
way I’ve worked for you? You’d abandon the family
and the home? You’d leave that good, pure girl,
Laura, just for a whim like this? I appeal to you, my
boy, in the name of the family&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s no use, grandfather. You’ve got to let me
go!” Unmoved he heard the old man plead:</p>

<p>“Have you no love for me, then? I’m in my declining
years. Without you what would be left? I’ve
lived for you, Hal, and in the hope of what you’d be
some day. I’ve hoped you’d marry Laura&mdash;I’ve
dreamed of grandchildren, of new light in the sunset
that’s guiding me to the western harbor. I’ve wanted
nothing but to give the end of my life to you and for
you, Hal&mdash;nothing but that!” In the captain’s eyes
gleamed a tear. Hal, noting it, felt secret scorn and
mockery. “I’m willing to overlook everything that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
past and give you a fresh start. God knows, I’d gladly
lay down my life for you! Because, Hal&mdash;you know
I love you, boy!”</p>

<p>Hal glanced appraisingly at the entreating old figure
on the bench, at the white head, the tear-blurred eyes,
the trembling outstretched hands. To what point, he
wondered with sinister calculation, could he turn this
blind affection to his own uses? He kept a moment’s
silence, then said in a tone that skilfully simulated
humilitude:</p>

<p>“I suppose I <i>am</i> a fool to have such thoughts, after
all. What is it you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“First, I want you to get off the lee shore. I’ll
pay your debts, Hal, and clear you. There are other
colleges, and as for McLaughlin, the money and apology
will satisfy him.”</p>

<p>“Apology? What apology?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he demands an apology from you, you understand?”</p>

<p>“He does, eh? Like&mdash;h-m! Well, I suppose I
can do that.” Hal kept his lying tongue to the deception
now essential to the success of his plans.</p>

<p>“Finely spoken, sir, and like a man!” exclaimed
Captain Briggs, with sudden joy and hope. “I knew
you’d come to it. You’re sound at heart, boy&mdash;sound
as old oak. You’re a Briggs, after all!”</p>

<p>“When do I have to make this apology?” asked Hal,
with a searching look. “Not right away?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m going to pay the money this afternoon.
In a day or two you can go aboard the schooner&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The schooner? You mean I’ve got to see him
<i>there</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. You see, he insists on the apology
where the assault was done. You’re to give it in front
of all the crew. I know that’ll be hard sailing, against
stiff winds of pride, but you’ll come through. You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
prove yourself a man, for your own sake as well as
Laura’s and mine, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Hal’s fists were clenched tight as he answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I’ll go through.” His eyes were
the eyes of murder, but the old captain saw only his
boy coming back to him again, dutiful and ready for a
new start in life. “I’ll do it, sir. Count on me!”</p>

<p>“Your hand, sir!”</p>

<p>The captain’s hand met his grandson’s in a grip that,
on one side, was all confidence and love; on the other,
abysmal treachery and wickedness. Hal said as the
grasp loosened:</p>

<p>“I’m asking only one little favor of you.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, boy?”</p>

<p>“Till this thing is all settled, let’s not talk about it
any more. No more than is strictly necessary. Please
don’t discuss it with the doctor, or with Ezra!”</p>

<p>“Ezra knows nothing. The doctor may talk a little,
but I’ll discourage it. From now on, Hal, there’ll be
very little said.”</p>

<p>“If you see Laura&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not a word to her. And from now on, Hal,
you’re going to make amends for what you’ve done,
and live it down, and prove yourself a man?”</p>

<p>“Why, sure!”</p>

<p>“You mean that, boy?”</p>

<p>“Of course I mean it! What shall I swear it on?
The blue-throated Mahadeo of the Hindus, or Vishnu
the Destroyer, or Ratna Mutnu Manikam, the Malay
Great God of Death? All three, if you say so!”</p>

<p>The captain shivered again, as if the cold breath of
ghosts from far, terrible graves had suddenly blown
upon him.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t talk that way, Hal,” said he
tremulously. “Just give me your word of honor.
Will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“As a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“As a ‘gentleman&mdash;unafraid!’”</p>

<p>Captain Briggs got up from the bench among the
tombs and put his tired old arm through the strong,
vigorous one of Hal, with a patriarchal affection of
great nobility.</p>

<p>“Come, boy!” said he, happy with new hopes.
“Come, we must be getting under way for Snug Haven&mdash;for
the little home you’re going to be so worthy of
and make so happy. The home where, some of these
fine days, I know you’ll bring Laura to comfort and
rejoice me. Come, boy, now let’s be going down the
hill!”</p>

<p>Together he and Hal made their way toward the
gate in the old stone wall, warm in the sunlight of
June.</p>

<p>A smile was on the captain’s time-worn face, a smile
of joy and peace. Hal was smiling, too, but with
mockery and craft and scorn.</p>

<p>“That’s the time I handed it out right and stalled
him proper!” he was thinking as they started down
the winding path amid the sumacs and wild roses.
“He’s easy, gramp is&mdash;a cinch! Getting moldy in
the attic. He’ll fall for anything. Now, if Laura’d
only been as easy! If she <i>had</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>Heavily, but still smiling, the old man leaned upon
Hal’s arm, finding comfort in the strength of the lusty
young scion of the family which, save for this one
hope, must perish.</p>

<p>“God has been very good to me, after all!” the
captain thought as they went down the hill. “I feared
God was going to punish me; but, after all, He has
been kind! ‘My cup runneth over&mdash;He leadeth me
beside the still waters,’ at last, after so many stormy
seas! Sunset of life is bringing peace&mdash;and somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
my Pilot’s waiting to tell me I have paid my
debt and that I’m entering port with a clean log!”</p>

<p>And Hal? What was Hal thinking now?</p>

<p>“Cinch is no name for it! The old man’s called off
all rough-house for a day or two. One day’s enough.
Just twenty-four hours. That’s all&mdash;that’s all I
need!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SAFE</p>

<p>Though a freshening east wind was now beginning
to add a raw salt tang to the air, troubled by a louder
suspiration of surf, and though the fluttering of the
poplar-leaves, which now had begun to show their
silvery undersides, predicted rain, all was bright sunshine
in the old man’s heart.</p>

<p>The drifting clouds in no wise lessened the light
for Captain Briggs. Nodding flower and piping bird,
grumbling bee and brisk, varnished cricket in the path
all bore him messages of cheer. His blue eyes mirrored
joy. For, after all that he had suffered and feared,
lo! here was Hal come back to him again, repentant,
dutiful and kind.</p>

<p>“God is being very good to me after all,” the old
captain kept thinking. “‘His mercy endureth forever,
and He is very, very good!’”</p>

<p>Dr. Filhiol, sitting at the window of his room, up-stairs,
watched the captain and Hal with narrowed eyes
that harbored suspicion. His lips drew tight, but he
uttered no word. Hal, glancing up, met his look with
instinctive defiance. Boldness and challenge leaped
into his eyes. Filhiol understood his threat:</p>

<p>“Keep yourself out of this or take all consequences!”</p>

<p>And again the thought came to the doctor:</p>

<p>“What wouldn’t I give to have you for a patient of
mine? Just for one hour!”</p>

<p>The captain and Hal disappeared ’round the ell, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which Filhiol had his room; but even after he had lost
them to sight, he sensed the fatuous self-deception of
the old man and the cruel baseness of the young one.
Hal’s overstrained effort at good fellowship grated on
the doctor’s nerves with a note as false as his forced
smile. He longed to warn the captain&mdash;and yet!
How could he make Briggs credit his suspicions? Impossible,
he realized.</p>

<p>“Poor captain!” he murmured. “Poor old captain!”
And so he sat there, troubled and very sad.</p>

<p>He heard their feet on the porch, then heard Hal
coming up-stairs, alone. Along the passageway went
Hal, muttering something unintelligible. Presently he
returned down-stairs again and went into the yard.
Filhiol swung his blinds shut. Much as he hated to
play the spy, instinct told he must.</p>

<p>Hal now had his pipe, and carried books and paper.
With these he sat down on the rustic seat that encircled
one of the captain’s big elms&mdash;a seat before which a
table had been built, for <i>al fresco</i> meals, or study. He
opened one of the books and began writing busily,
while smoke curled on the breeze now growing damp
and raw. Even the doctor could not but admit Hal
made an attractive figure in his white flannels.</p>

<p>“Pure camouflage, that study is,” pondered the doctor.
“That smile augurs no good.” Down-stairs he
heard Briggs moving about, and pity welled again.
“This is bad, bad. There’s something in the wind, <i>I</i>
know. Tss-tss-tss! What a wicked, cruel shame!”</p>

<p>Down in the cabin, Captain Briggs’s appearance quite
belied the doctor’s pity. Every line of his venerable
face showed deep content. In his eyes lay beatitude.</p>

<p>“Thank God, the boy’s true-blue, after all!” he
murmured. “Just a little wild, perhaps, but he’s a
Briggs&mdash;he’s sound metal at the core. Thank God
for that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened the top drawer of his desk, took out a
little slip of paper that helped refresh his memory, and
approached the safe. Right, left, he turned the knob,
as the combination on the paper bade him; then he
swung open the doors, and pulled out a little drawer.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs, sir!”</p>

<p>At sound of Ezra’s voice in the doorway, he started
almost guiltily.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Anythin’ you’re wantin’ down to Dudley’s store,
sir?”</p>

<p>“No, Ezra.” The captain’s answer seemed uneasy.
Under the sharp boring of Ezra’s steely eyes, he
quailed. “No, there’s nothing.”</p>

<p>“All right, cap’n!” The old cook remained a moment,
observing. Then with the familiarity of long
years, he queried:</p>

<p>“Takin’ money again, be you? Whistlin’ whales,
cap’n, that won’t do!”</p>

<p>“Ezra! What d’you mean, sir!”</p>

<p>“You know, cap’n, we’re gittin’ mighty nigh the
bottom o’ the locker.”</p>

<p>“You’re sailing a bit wide, Ezra!”</p>

<p>“Mebbe, sir.” The honest old fellow’s voice expressed
deep anxiety. “But you an’ me is cap’n an’
mate o’ this here clipper, an’ money’s money.”</p>

<p>The voices drifting out the open window brought
Hal’s head up, listening. The doctor, peering through
the blinds, saw him hesitate a moment, peer ’round,
then cross the lawn to where, screened by the thick
clump of lilac-bushes, he could peek into the room.</p>

<p>“Money’s money, cap’n,” repeated Ezra. “We
hadn’t oughta let it go too fast.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots of better things in this world than
money, Ezra,” said the captain, strangely ill at ease.</p>

<p>“Mebbe, sir, but it takes money to buy ’em,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cook retorted. “I ain’t a two-dollar-worry man fer
a one-dollar loss, but still I know a dollar’s a good
little friend.”</p>

<p>“Happiness is better,” affirmed the captain.
“What I’m going to spend this money for now will
bring me happiness. Better than all the money in the
world, is being contented with your lot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if it’s a lot of money, or a corner lot in a
live town. <i>I</i> think there’s six things to make a man
happy. One is a good cook an’ the other five is cash.
However, fur be it from me to argy with you. I got
to clear fer Dudley’s, or there wun’t be no dinner.”</p>

<p>Ezra withdrew.</p>

<p>“It’s that damn McLaughlin, I betcha,” he pondered.
“I got an intuition the cap’n’s got to pay him
heavy. Intuition’s a guess, when it comes out right;
an’ I’ll bet a schooner to a saucepan I’m right this
time. If I was half the man I used to be, it wouldn’t
be money McLaughlin’d be gittin’, but <i>this</i>!” Menacingly,
he doubled his fist.</p>

<p>Captain Briggs took from the safe a packet of bills
and counted off four hundred dollars. This money he
put into his wallet. Hal watched every move; while
above, from behind the blinds, Dr. Filhiol observed
him with profound attention.</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i> getting a bit low in the treasury,” admitted
the captain, inspecting the remainder of the cash.
“Only a matter of seven hundred and fifty left, to
stand us till January. A bit low, but we’ll manage
some way or other. Sail close to the wind, and make
it. After all, what’s a little money when the boy’s
whole life is at stake?”</p>

<p>He put the remaining bills back and closed the safe.
To the desk he walked, dropped the combination into
it and shut it, tight. Silently Hal slid back to his seat
under the elm, and once more set himself to writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Filhiol peered down at him with animosity.</p>

<p>“A nice little treatment of strychnine or <i>curaré</i>
might make a proper man of you, you brute,” he muttered,
“but, by the living Lord, I don’t think anything
else could!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE READING OF THE CURSE</p>

<p>The kitchen door slammed. Ezra, turning the corner
of the house, paused to gaze with admiration at
Hal.</p>

<p>“Hello, Master Hal, sir,” said he. “Always studyin’,
ain’t you?” Voice and expression alike showed
intense pride. Above, Filhiol bent an ear of keenest
attention. “Ain’t many young fellers in this town
would be workin’ over books, when there’s petticoats in
sight.”</p>

<p>“You don’t approve of the girls, eh?” asked Hal
with a smile. A smile of the lips alone, not of the
eyes.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t,” answered Ezra with resentment&mdash;for
once upon a time a woman had misused him,
and the wound had never healed. “They ain’t what I
call good reliable craft, sir. Contrary at the wheel, an’
their rig costs more ’n what their hull’s wu’th. No,
sir, I ain’t overly fond of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Your judgment’s not valid,” said Hal. He seemed
peculiarly expansive, as if for some reason of his own
he wanted to win Ezra to still greater affection.
“What do <i>you</i> know about women, an old bach like
you?”</p>

<p>“I know!” affirmed Ezra, coming over the lawn to
the table. “Men are like nails&mdash;when they’re drove
crooked, they’re usually drove so by a woman. Women
can make a fool of almost any man, ef nature
don’t git a start on ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal laughed. A certain malevolent content seemed
radiating from him. Lazily he leaned back, and drew
at his pipe. “Right or wrong, you’ve certainly got
definite opinions. You know your own mind. You
believe in a man knowing himself, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ef some men knowed themselves they’d be
ashamed o’ the acquaintance,” opined Ezra. “An’
most women would. No, sir, I don’t take no stock in
’em. There ain’t nothin’ certain about love but the
uncertainty. Women ain’t satisfied with the milk o’
human kindness. They want all the cream. What
they expect is a sealskin livin’ on a mushrat salary.
Love’s a kind of paralysis&mdash;kind of a stroke, like.
Sometimes it’s only on one side an’ there’s hope. But
ef it gits on both sides, it’s hopeless.”</p>

<p>“Love makes the world go ’round, Ezra!”</p>

<p>“Like Tophet! It only makes folks’ heads spin,
an’ they <i>think</i> the world’s goin’ ’round, that’s all. Nobody
knows the value of a gold-mine or a woman, but
millions o’ men has went busted, tryin’ to find out!
Not fer me, this here lovin’, sir,” Ezra continued with
eloquence. “I never yet see a matrimonial match
struck but what somebody got burned. Marriage is
the end o’ trouble, as the feller says&mdash;but which
end? I ask you!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t ask <i>me</i>, Ezra; I’m no authority on
women. There’s a nice little proverb in this book,
though, that you ought to know.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Master Hal?”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll find it for you.” Hal turned a few
pages, paused, and read: “‘<i>Bounga sedap dipakey,
layou dibouang.</i>’”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ snails! What <i>is</i> that stuff, anyhow?
Heathen Chinee?”</p>

<p>“That’s Malay, Ezra,” Hal condescended. The
doctor, listening, felt a strange little shiver, as of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
reminiscent fear from the vague long-ago. Those
words, last heard at Batu Kawan, fifty years before,
now of a sudden rose to him like specters of great evil.
His attention strained itself as Hal went on:</p>

<p>“That’s a favorite Malay proverb, and it means:
‘While the flower is pleasing to man, he wears it.
When it fades, he throws it away.’”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ a woman, o’ course? Uhuh! <i>I</i> see.
Well, them heathens has it pretty doggone nigh correct,
at that, ain’t they? So that there is Malay, is it? All
them twisty-wisty whirligigs? An’ you can read it
same as if it was a real language?”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a real language, Ezra, and a very beautiful
one. I love it. You don’t know how much!” A
tone of real sincerity crept into the false camaraderie
of Hal’s voice. Filhiol shook his head. Vague, incomprehensible
influences seemed reaching out from
the vapors of the Orient, fingering their way into the
very heart of this trim New England garden, in this
year of grace, 1918. The doctor suddenly felt cold.
He crouched a little closer toward the blinds.</p>

<p>“Holy halibut, Master Hal!” exclaimed Ezra in an
awed tone, peering at the book. “What a head you
got on you, sir! Fuller o’ brains than an old Bedford
whaler is o’ rats!”</p>

<p>“You flatter me, Ezra. Think so, do you?”</p>

<p>“I know so! Ef I’d had your peak I wouldn’t of
walloped pots in a galley all my natural. But I wan’t
pervided good. My mind’s like a pint o’ rum in a
hogshead&mdash;kind of broad, but not very deep. It’s
sort of a phonograph mind&mdash;makes me talk a lot, but
don’t make me say nothin’ original. So that’s Malay,
is it? Well, it’s too numerous fer <i>me</i>. There’s only
one kind o’ Malay I know about, an’ that’s my hens.
They may lay, an’ then again they may not. That’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
grammatical. But this here wiggly printin’&mdash;no, no,
it don’t look reasonable. My eye, what a head! Read
some more, will you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you like it,” said Hal, strangely obliging.
“Here’s something I’ve been translating, in the
line of cursing. They’re great people to curse you,
the Malays are, if you cross them. Their whole lives
are full of vengeance&mdash;that’s what makes them so interesting.
Nothing weak, forgiving or mushy about
<i>them</i>!” He picked up the paper he had been writing
on, and cast his eyes over it, while Ezra looked down
at him with fondly indulgent pride. “Here is part
of the black curse of Vishnu.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“One of their gods. The most avenging one of
the lot,” explained Hal. The doctor, crouching behind
the blinds, shivered.</p>

<p>“Gods, eh? What’s this Vishnu feller like?” asked
Ezra, with a touch of uneasiness. “Horns an’ a
tail?”</p>

<p>“No. He’s got several forms, but the one they
seem most afraid of is a kind of great, blind face up in
the sky. A face that&mdash;even though it’s blind&mdash;can
watch a guilty man all his life, wherever he goes, and
ruin him, crucify him, bring him to destruction, and
laugh at him as he’s dying.”</p>

<p>“<i>Brrr!</i>” said Ezra. He seemed to feel something
of the same cold that had struck to the doctor’s heart&mdash;a
greater cold than could be accounted for by the
veiling of the sun behind the clouds now driving in
from the sea, or by the kelp-rank mists gathering along
the shore. “You make me feel all creepylike. You’re
wastin’ your time on such stuff, Master Hal, same as a
man is when he’s squeezing a bad lemon or an old maid.
None o’ that cursin’ stuff fer me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you’ve got to listen to it!” insisted Hal
maliciously. Ezra’s trepidation afforded him great
enjoyment. “Here’s the way it goes:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘The curse of Vishnu, the great black curse, can never
end unsatisfied when it has once been laid upon a human
head. Beyond the land it carries, and beyond the sea, beyond
the farthest sea unsailed. Beyond the day, the month,
the year, it carries; and even though the accursèd one flee
forever, in some far place and on some far day it will fall
on him or his!’”</p>

<p class="p1">“Great grampus!” cried the old man, retreating a
little with wide eyes. “That’s <i>some</i> cussin’, all
right!”</p>

<p>The doctor sensed an insistent fear that would not
be denied. What if old Captain Briggs should overhear
this colloquy? What if Ezra should repeat to
him these words that, now arising from the past,
echoed with ominous purport? At realization of possible
consequences, Filhiol’s heart contracted painfully.</p>

<p>“Damn you, Hal!” thought he, peering out through
the blinds. “Damn you and your Malay books. If
any harm comes to the captain, through you, look
out!”</p>

<p>“Some awful cussin’,” Ezra repeated. “I
wouldn’t want to have no sech cuss as that rove onta
<i>me</i>! You b’lieve that stuff, do ye?”</p>

<p>“Who am I to disprove it?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t there no way to kedge off, ef you’re grounded
on a cuss like that?”</p>

<p>“Only one, Ezra, according to this book.”</p>

<p>“What way’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” and Hal once more glanced at the paper,
“well, this is what the book says:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘The curse must be fulfilled, to the last breath, for by
Shiva and the Trimurthi, what is written is written. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
if he through whom the curse descendeth on another is
stricken to horror and to death, then the Almighty Vishnu,
merciful, closes that page. And he who through another’s
sin was cursed, is cleansed. Thus may the curse be fulfilled.
But always one of two must die. <i>Tuan Allah poonia
krajah!</i> It is the work of the Almighty One! One of two
must die!’”</p>

<p class="p1">“Gosh!” ejaculated Ezra. “I reckon that’ll be
about enough fer me, Master Hal. Awful, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t like Malay, after all?” laughed Hal.</p>

<p>“Can’t say as I’m pinin’ fer it. But you got some
head on you, to read it off like that. I s’pose it’s all
right in its way, but I don’t relish it overly, as the
feller said when he spilled sugar on his oysters.
Well,” and he glanced at the lowering clouds and the
indrifting sea-fog that with the characteristic suddenness
of the north shore had already begun to throw its
chilly blanket over the world, “well, this ain’t gittin’
to Dudley’s store, is it? Lord, sir, what a head you
got on you!”</p>

<p>With admiring ejaculations the old man started
down the path once more. The doctor, filled with
stern thoughts, remained watching Hal, who had now
gone back to his writing.</p>

<p>“What a fatality!” pondered the doctor, unable to
suppress a certain superstitious dread. Not all his
scientific training could quite overcome the deep-rooted
superstition that lies in the bottom of every human
heart. “The black curse of Vishnu again, with this
new feature: ‘<i>One of two must die!</i>’ What the devil
does all this mean now?”</p>

<p>A crawling sensation manifested itself along his
spine. Silent shapes seemed standing behind him in
the corners of the room darkened by the closing of the
blinds. Trained thinker though he was, he could not
shake off this feeling, but remained crouching at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
window, a prey to inexplicable fear. The words Hal
had spoken, echoing along dim corridors of the past,
still seemed vibrating in his heart with unaccustomed
pain.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he growled at last. “It’s all nonsense&mdash;nothing
but a sheer coincidence!” He tried
to put the words away, but still they sounded in his
ears: “<i>One of two must die! Always one of two
must die!</i>”</p>

<p>Another thought, piercing him, brought him up
standing with clenched fists.</p>

<p>“If the captain ever gets hold of that idea, what
then? If he ever does&mdash;<i>what then</i>?”</p>

<p>Brooding he paced up and down the room, limping
painfully, for without his cane he could hardly walk
even a few steps. And almost at once his fear curdled
into hate against the sleek, white-flanneled fellow, sitting
there under the elm, calmly translating words that
might mean agony and death to the old grandsire.</p>

<p>Filhiol’s mind became confused. He knew not what
to think, nor yet which way to turn. What events impended?
He recalled the way Hal had peered stealthily
into the cabin, and how he had then slid back to his
seat under the elm. Was Hal plotting some new
infamy? What could be done to warn the captain, to
make that blindly loyal heart accept the truth and act
upon it?</p>

<p>Tentacles of some terrible thing seemed enmeshing
both Filhiol and the old captain&mdash;some catastrophe,
looming black, impossible to thrust aside. But it was
not of himself that Filhiol was thinking. Only the
image of the captain, trusting, confident, arose before
him.</p>

<p>Filhiol set his teeth in a grimace of hate against the
figure at work out there under the big elm.</p>

<p>“I’ve probably done my share of evil in this world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>”
thought he, “but I could wipe it all out with one supremely
good action. If I could put an end to <i>you</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>All unconscious, Hal continued at his work. As he
wrote, he smiled a little. The smile was sinister and
hard.</p>

<p>What thoughts did it reflect?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ROBBERY</p>

<p>Dinner brought the four men together: Filhiol glum
and dour, Hal in his most charming mood, the captain
expansive with new-found happiness, and old Ezra
bubbling with aphorisms.</p>

<p>Silent and brooding, Filhiol turned the situation in
his mind, asking himself a hundred times what he
could do to avert catastrophe impending.</p>

<p>Decision, after dinner, crystallized into action.
First of all the doctor interviewed Ezra in the galley,
and from him extracted a binding promise to make no
mention before Captain Briggs, of anything concerning
Malay life, or books, or curses, or whatever.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain now, Ezra,” said he, “but it’s
most important. As a physician, I prohibit your speaking
of these matters here. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I dunno’s I’m over an’ above keen to
obey you, sir, but ef it’s fer the cap’n’s good, that’s
enough fer me.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> for the captain’s good, decidedly!” affirmed
the doctor, and left old Ezra to think it over. One
source of danger, he now felt confident, had been
dammed up.</p>

<p>Ezra was still thinking it over when the captain told
him to harness Sea Lawyer for a drive to Endicutt.
In spite of the fine, drifting rain that had set in,
Briggs was determined to go, for until McLaughlin’s
claim and the college bill had been settled, the money
he had taken from the safe for that purpose was burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in his pocket. He insisted on going quite alone,
despite protests from Filhiol and Ezra. Even though
all the sunlight had died from the darkening sky, it
seemed still shining in the old man’s eyes as he drove
off to pay the hard-saved money that now&mdash;so he believed&mdash;would
put Hal on the upward road once
more.</p>

<p>“Hal,” said the doctor, when the old captain had
slowly jogged out of sight, “I’ve got a few words to
say to you, out on the porch. Give me five minutes,
please?”</p>

<p>“Why, surest thing you know! Just let me get my
pipe, and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<p>He seemed all engaging candor&mdash;just a big, powerful
fellow, open of face and manner, good-humored
and without guile. As he rejoined the doctor, Filhiol
wondered whether, after all, his analysis might
not be wrong. But no, no. Something at the back
of Hal’s blue-eyed look, something arrogant with
power, something untamed, atavistic, looked out
through even the most direct glance. Filhiol knew
that he was dealing with no ordinary force. And,
carefully choosing his words, he said:</p>

<p>“Listen, young man. I’m going to ask a favor of
you.”</p>

<p>“My grandfather’s guest has only to ask, and it’s
done,” smiled Hal, as he settled himself in one of the
rockers, and hoisted his white-shod feet to the porch-rail.</p>

<p>“You know, Hal,” the doctor commenced, “your
grandfather has been greatly distressed about your conduct.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?” asked Hal, his eyes clouding.</p>

<p>“He has a strange idea that some of the misdeeds
of his youth, long since atoned for, are being visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
upon you, and that he’s responsible for&mdash;h-m&mdash;certain
irregularities of your conduct.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“In short, he half believes a curse is resting on you,
because of him. It would be most deplorable to let
that belief receive corroboration from any source, as
for example, from any of your Oriental studies.”</p>

<p>Hal shot a keen glance at the old man. This was
indeed getting under the hide, with a vengeance. The
glance showed fear, too. Had Filhiol, then, been spying
on him? Had he, by any chance, seen him peeking
in at the window, through the lilac-bushes? Hal’s
evil temper began to stir, and with it a very lively apprehension.</p>

<p>“What are you driving at, anyhow?” demanded he,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“I want you to keep your Oriental stuff completely
in the background for a while. Not to talk with him
about it, and especially to avoid all those fantastic
curses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all?” asked Hal, relieved. “Well,
that’s easy.”</p>

<p>The doctor sighed with relief.</p>

<p>“That makes me feel a bit better,” said he. “We’ve
got to do our best to protect the captain against himself.
I know you’ll coöperate with me to keep him out
of any possible trouble.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, doctor!” exclaimed Hal.
“I’ve been a fool and worse, I know, but that’s all
over. I’ve taken a fresh start that will help me travel
far. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>He put out his hand.</p>

<p>“Let’s shake on it,” he smiled winningly.</p>

<p>A moment their eyes met. Then Filhiol said:</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I’ve misjudged you. Let’s just forget
it. You don’t know how much relieved I feel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel better, too,” said Hal. “Things are going
to take a decidedly new turn.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine to hear you say that!” exclaimed the doctor,
almost convinced that at last he had struck a
human stratum in the boy’s heart. “I can take my
after-dinner nap with a great deal easier mind now.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>He limped into the house, not perhaps fully confident
of Hal, but at any rate more inclined to believe
him amenable to reason. Hal, peering after him, whispered
a terrific blasphemy under his breath.</p>

<p>“You damned buttinsky!” he growled, black with
passion. “There’s something coming to you, too.
Something you’ll get, by God, or I’m no man!”</p>

<p>He got up, and&mdash;silently in his rubber-soled shoes&mdash;walked
around the porch to the end of it, then
stepped down into the grass and crept along by the
house. Under the doctor’s window he stood, listening
acutely. Just what the doctor was doing he must by
all means know. Ezra was safe enough. From the
kitchen drifted song:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Rolling Rio,<br />
To my rolling Rio Grande!<br />
Hooray, you rolling Rio!<br />
So fare ye well, my bonny young girls,<br />
For I’m bound to the Rio Grande!”</p>

<p class="p1">Hal nodded as he heard the springs of the doctor’s
bed creak, and knew the old man had really laid down
for his mid-afternoon nap.</p>

<p>“It’s working fine,” said he. “Gramp’s gone,
Ezra’s good for half an hour on ‘Rio Grande,’ and the
doc’s turned in. Looks like a curse was sticking to
me, doesn’t it? Not much! Nothing like that can
stick to <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>At his feet two or three ants were busy with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
grasshopper’s leg. Hal smeared them out with a dab
of his sole.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do with people that get in your
way,” he muttered. “Just like that!”</p>

<p>He slouched back to the porch. The resemblance
to what Captain Briggs had been in the old days seemed
wonderfully striking at just this moment. Same hang
of heavy shoulders, same set of jaw; scowl quite a
simulacrum of the other, and even the dark glowering
of the eyes almost what once had been.</p>

<p>As Hal Briggs lithely stepped on to the porch again
he formed how wonderful an image of that other man
who, half a century ago, had swung the poisoned kris
upon the decks of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>, and, smeared with
blood, had hewn his way against all opposition to his
will!</p>

<p>“Afraid of an old Malay curse!” sneered Hal.
“Poor, piffling fool! Why, Filhiol’s loose in the
dome, and grandpop’s no better. They’re a couple of
children&mdash;ought to be shoved into the nursery. And
they think they’re going to dictate to <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>He paused a moment at the front door to listen. No
sound from within indicated any danger.</p>

<p>“Think they’re going to keep me in this graveyard
burg!” he gibed. “And stop my having that girl!
Well, they’ve got another think coming. She’s mine,
that young porpoise. She’s mine!”</p>

<p>Into the cabin he made his way, noiselessly, closed
the hall door and smiled with exultation.</p>

<p>He needed but a moment to reach the desk, take out
the little slip of paper on which the captain had written
the combination, and go to the safe.</p>

<p>A few turns of the knob, and the iron door swung
wide. Open came the money-compartment. With
exultant hands, filled with triumph and evil pride, Hal
caught up the sheaf of bills there, quickly counted off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
five hundred dollars, took a couple more bills for good
luck, crammed the money into his pocket, and replaced
the pitifully small remnant in the compartment.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’ve got to leave any,” he reflected, “but
it’ll be safer. It may keep him from noticing. The
old man wouldn’t let me have a boat, eh? And Laura
turned me down, did she? Well now, we’ll soon see
about all that!”</p>

<p>“Master Hal, sir! What <i>in</i> the name o’ Tophet are
you up to?”</p>

<p>The sound of Ezra’s voice swung Hal sharp around.
So intent had he been that he had quite failed to notice
the cessation of the old cook’s chantey. A moment,
Hal’s eyes, staring, met those of the astonished servitor.
Ominous silence filled the room.</p>

<p>“Why, Master Hal!” Ezra quavered. “You&mdash;ain’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You sneaking spy!” Hal growled at him, even in
his rage and panic careful to keep his voice low, lest he
awake the doctor, abovestairs. Toward the old man
he advanced, with rowdy oaths of the fo’cs’le.</p>

<p>Ezra stood his ground.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> ain’t no spy, Master Hal,” he exclaimed, tremblingly.
“But I come into the dinin’-saloon, here, an’
couldn’t help seein’. Tell me it ain’t so, Master Hal!
Tell me you ain’t sunk so low as to be robbin’ your own
grandpa, while he’s to town in all this rain, settlin’ up
things fer you! Not that, Master Hal&mdash;not that!”</p>

<p>“Ezra, you damn son-of-a-sea-cook!” snarled Hal,
his face the face of murder. “You call me a thief
again, and so help me but I’ll wring your neck!” His
hand caught Ezra by the throat and closed in a gorilla-grip,
shutting off all breath. “You didn’t learn your
lesson from the club last night, eh? Well, I’ll teach
you one now, you old gray rat! I’ll shut <i>your</i> mouth,
damn you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Viciously he shook the weak old man. Ezra clawed
with impotent hands at the vise-clutch strangling him.</p>

<p>“It’s my money, my own money, understand?” Hal
spat at him. “Every penny of it’s mine. He didn’t
want me to have it just yet, but I’m going to, and
you’re not going to blow on me! If you <i>do</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>He loosed his hold, snatched down from its supporting
hooks the Malay kris, and with it gripped in
hand confronted the trembling, half-fainting cook.</p>

<p>“See this, Ezra?” And Hal shook the envenomed
blade before the poor old fellow’s horror-smitten eyes.</p>

<p>“Master&mdash;Master Hal!”</p>

<p>“If you breathe so much as one syllable to the captain,
I’ll split you with this knife, as sure as I’m a foot
high! What? Butting in on me, in my own house,
are you? Like hell! Take a slant at this knife here,
and see how you’d like it through your guts!”</p>

<p>He raised it as if to strike. Ezra cowered, shrinking
with the imminent terror of death.</p>

<p>“Master Hal, oh, fer God’s sake, now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re going to keep your jaw-tackle quiet, are
you, to the captain?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>

<p>Wickedly Hal slashed at him. Ezra opened his
mouth, no doubt to cry aloud, but Hal clapped a
sinewed hand over it, and slammed him back against
the wall.</p>

<p>“Not a word more!” he commanded, and released
the trembling old man. “I’ve got to turn you loose,
Ezra, but if you double-cross me, so help me God&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You callin’ on God, Master Hal?” quavered Ezra.
“You, with your heathen curses an’ your Malay sword,
an’ all the evil seed you’re sowin’ fer a terrible crop o’
misery?”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you!”</p>

<p>“Goin’ on this way, Master Hal, after you jest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
promised the cap’n you was goin’ to begin at the bottom
o’ the ladder an’ climb ag’in? This here ain’t the bottom;
this here is a deep ditch you’re diggin’, fur below
that bottom. Oh, Master Hal,” and Ezra’s shaking
hands went out in passionate appeal, “ef you got any
love fer the memory o’ your dead mother; ef you got
any fer your grandpa, what’s been so wonderful good
to you; ef you got any little grain o’ gratitude to me,
fer all these long years&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ezra, you bald-headed old pot-walloper, I’m going
to count ten on you,” Hal interrupted, terrible with
rage. “If, by the end of that time you haven’t sworn
to keep your mouth shut about this, I’m going to kill
you right here in this room! I mean that, Ezra!”</p>

<p>“But ef it’s y’r own money, Master Hal, why should
you be afeared to let him know?”</p>

<p>Hal struck the old man a staggering blow in the face.
“You keep your voice down,” he snarled. “If you
wake the doctor, and he comes down here, God help
the pair of you! Now, Ezra, I’m not going to trifle
with you any longer. You’re going to swear secrecy,
and do it quick, or take the consequences!”</p>

<p>He turned, caught up the captain’s well-thumbed
Bible from the desk, and with the Bible in one hand,
the poisoned kris in the other, confronted Ezra.</p>

<p>“Here! Lay your hand on this book, damn quick!”
he ordered. “And repeat what I tell you. Quick,
now; <i>quick!</i>”</p>

<p>The argument of the raised kris overbore Ezra’s
resistance. With a look of heart-breaking anguish
he laid a trembling, veinous hand on the Bible.</p>

<p>“What is it, Master Hal?” quavered he. “What
d’ye want me to say?”</p>

<p>“Say this: ‘If I betray this secret&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“‘If I&mdash;if I betray this secret&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“‘May the black curse of Vishnu fall on me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>“‘May the’&mdash;listen, Master Hal! Please now,
jest one minute!”</p>

<p>“Ezra, say it, damn your stiff, obstinate neck! Say
it, or you get the knife!”</p>

<p>“‘May the black curse o’&mdash;o’ Vishnoo fall on me!”</p>

<p>“‘And may his poisoned kris strike through my
heart!’”</p>

<p>“No, no, sir, I can’t say that!” pleaded the simple
old fellow, ashen to the lips, his forehead lined with
deep wrinkles of terror.</p>

<p>“You <i>will</i> say it, Ezra, and you’ll mean it, or by
the powers of darkness I’ll butcher you where you
stand!” menaced Hal. “And you’ll say it quick,
too!” Hal was nerving his hand to do cold murder.
“One, two, three, four! Say it now before I cut you
down! There’s blood on this knife, Ezra. See the
dark stains? Blood, that my grandfather put on
there, fifty years ago&mdash;that’s what I’ve heard among
old sailors&mdash;put on there, because some of his men
wouldn’t obey him. Well, I can play the same game.
What he did, I can do, and will! There’ll be more
blood on it, fresh blood, your blood, if you don’t mind
me. Five, six, seven! Say it, you obstinate cur!”</p>

<p>Up rose the kris again, ready to strike. Hal’s eyes
were glowing. His lips had drawn back, showing
the gleam of white teeth.</p>

<p>“Keep your hand on that Bible, Ezra! Take that
oath. Say it! Eight, nine, t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll say it, Master Hal! I’ll say it!” gasped the
old man. “Don’t kill me&mdash;<i>don’t</i>!”</p>

<p>“Say it, then: ‘May this poisoned kris strike
through my heart!’”</p>

<p>“‘M-m-may this poisoned kris&mdash;strike through&mdash;my&mdash;heart!’
There now! Oh! Now I’ve said it.
Let me go&mdash;let me go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go, and be damned to you! Get out o’ here, you
spying <i>surka-batcha</i>&mdash;you son-of-a-pig!”</p>

<p>Hal dropped the Bible back on to the desk, swung
Ezra ’round, and pitched him, staggering, into the dining-saloon.
Ezra dragged himself away, quaking,
ghastly, to his own room, there to lock himself in.
Spent, terrified, he threw himself upon his bunk, and
lay there, half dead.</p>

<p>Well satisfied, Hal reviewed the situation.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve kept <i>him</i> quiet for a while,” he muttered.
“Long enough, anyhow. I won’t need much
more time now.”</p>

<p>Back to the fireplace he turned, hung up the kris
again on its hooks, glanced around to assure himself
he had left no traces of his robbery. He closed the
door of the safe, spun the knob, and in the desk-drawer
replaced the slip of paper bearing the combination.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve fixed things so they’ll hold a while
now,” judged he. “God, what a place&mdash;what people!
Spies, all spies! They’re all spying on me here. And
Laura’s giving me the laugh, too. Maybe I won’t
show them all a thing or two!”</p>

<p>He listened a moment, and, satisfied, opened the
door into the front hall. To all appearances the coast
was free. He snatched a cap, jammed it upon his
head, and, hunching into an old raincoat, quietly left
the house.</p>

<p>The Airedale would have followed him, but with
the menace of an upraised fist he sent it back. Through
the gate he went, and turned toward the right, in the
direction of Hadlock’s Cove, where dwelt Jim Gordon,
owner of the <i>Kittiwink</i>.</p>

<p>In his ears the wind, ever-rising, and the shouting
of the quick-lashed surf along the rocks joined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the slash of the rain to make a chorus glad and mighty,
to which his heart expanded. On and on he strode,
exultant, filled with evil devisings of a mind half mad
in the lusts of strength and passion. And as he went
he held communion with himself:</p>

<p>“I’ll beat ’em to it&mdash;and devil take anything that
stands in my way! To hell with them&mdash;to hell with
everything that goes against me!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">SELF-SACRIFICE</p>

<p>The rapidly increasing northeast storm, that meant
so little to Hal Briggs, thoroughly drenched and chilled
the old captain long before he reached home.</p>

<p>By the time he had navigated back to Snug Haven,
he was wet to the bone, and was shivering with the
drive of the gale now piling gray lines of breakers
along the shore. Dr. Filhiol, his face very hard, met
the old captain at the front door; while Ezra&mdash;silent,
dejected, with acute misery and fear&mdash;took the ancient
horse away up the puddled lane.</p>

<p>“This is outrageous, captain!” the doctor expostulated.
“The idea of your exposing yourself this way
at your age!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Hal?” shivered the captain. “I’ve got
to see Hal! G-g-got to tell him all his debts are paid,
and he’s a free man again!”</p>

<p>“You’re hoarse as a frog, sir; you’ve got a thundering
cold!” chided the doctor. “I order you to bed,
sir, where I’ll give you a stiff glass of whisky and
lemon, and sweat you properly.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” chattered the captain. “I’ll j-j-just
change my clothes, and sit by the fire, and I’ll be all
r-r-right. Where’s Hal? I want Hal!”</p>

<p>“Hal? How do <i>I</i> know?” demanded Filhiol.
“He’s gone. Where’s he bound for? No good, I’ll
warrant, in this storm. It shows how much <i>he</i> cares,
what you do for him, the way he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By the Judas priest, sir!” interrupted Briggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
“I’m not going to have anything said against Hal, now
he’s free. I know you’re my guest, doctor, but don’t
drive me too far!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll say no more. But now, into your bunk!
There’s no argument about <i>that</i>, anyhow. Bathrobe
and hot water-bottle now, and a good tot of rum!”</p>

<p>The captain had to yield. A quarter-hour later the
doctor had him safely tucked into his berth in the
cabin, with whisky and lemon aboard him. “There,
that’s better,” approved Filhiol. “You’ll do now,
unless you get up, and take another chill. I want you
to stay right there till to-morrow at the very least.
Understand me? Now, I prescribe a nap for you.
And a good sweat, and by to-morrow you’ll be fine as
silk.”</p>

<p>“All right, doctor,” agreed Briggs, though Hal’s absence
troubled him sore. “There’s only one thing I
want you to do. Put my receipts in the safe.”</p>

<p>“What receipts?”</p>

<p>“For the cash I paid Squire Bean and for the money-order
I sent the college.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“In my wallet, there, in that inside coat-pocket,” answered
Briggs, pointing to the big blue coat hung over
a chair by the fire. “The combination of the safe
is in that top drawer, on a slip of paper. You can open
the safe easy enough.”</p>

<p>“All right, anything to please you,” grumbled the
old doctor. “Where shall I put the receipts, captain?”</p>

<p>“In the cash-drawer. Inner drawer, top, right.”</p>

<p>Filhiol located the drawer and dropped the precious
receipts into it. His eyes, that could still see
quite plainly by the fading, gray light of the stormy
late afternoon, descried a few bills in the drawer.</p>

<p>“It’s been a terrible expense to you, captain,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
he with the license of long years of acquaintanceship.
“Down a bit on the cash now, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor, down a bit. Plims’l-mark’s under
water this time. But I’m not foundering just yet.
There’s still seven hundred and fifty or so.”</p>

<p>“Seven fifty?” asked the doctor, squinting. A
sudden suspicion laid hold of him as he eyed the slender
pile of bills. With crooked fingers he ran them over.
“Why, there’s not&mdash;<i>h-m! h-m!</i>” he checked himself.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that, sir?” asked the captain, drowsy
already.</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir,” answered Filhiol. “I was just going
to say there’s not many as well fixed as you are,
captain. Even though your cash <i>is</i> low, you’ve got a
pretty comfortable place here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it’s pretty snug,” sleepily assented Briggs.
“And now that Hal’s coming back, I’m happy. A
few dollars&mdash;they don’t matter, eh?”</p>

<p>Hastily Filhiol counted the bills. Only a matter of
about two hundred and twenty-five dollars remained.
As in a flash the old doctor comprehended everything.</p>

<p>“<i>Tss! Tss!</i>” clucked the doctor, going a shade
paler. But he said no more.</p>

<p>He closed the safe and put the combination back into
the desk-drawer. For a moment he stood leaning on
his cane, peering down at the captain, who was already
going to sleep. Then he shook his head, grief and
rage on his face.</p>

<p>“God!” he was thinking. “Robbery! On top of
everything else, downright robbery! This will certainly
kill the old man! What black devil is in that
boy anyhow? What devil out of hell?”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, looking with profound compassion
at the tired old captain. Then he limped out
of the room, and made his way to the galley, bent on
having speech with Ezra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Down the walk from the barn Ezra was at this moment
coming, shoulders bent against the storm, hat-brim
trickling water. The rain was now slashing
viciously, in pelting ribbons of gray water that
drummed on the tin roof of the kitchen and danced in
spatters on the walk.</p>

<p>Filhiol opened the door for Ezra, who peeled off
his coat, and shook his wet hands.</p>

<p>“Great, creepin’ clams!” he puffed. “But this is
some tidy wind, sir! These here Massachusetts storms
can’t be beat, the way they pounce. An’ rain! Say!
Must be a picnic somewhere nigh. Never rains like
this unless there <i>is</i> one!”</p>

<p>The old man tried to smile, but joviality was lacking.
He closed the door and came over to the stove.
The doctor followed him.</p>

<p>“Ezra,” said he, “you don’t like me. No matter.
You <i>do</i> like Captain Briggs, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t a question as needs answerin’,” returned
Ezra, with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>“I like the captain, too,” continued Filhiol.
“We’ve got to join hands to help him. And he’s in
very, very serious trouble now.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” The old servitor sensed what
was in the wind, and braced himself to meet it.</p>

<p>“If it came to choosing between Hal and the captain,
which would you stand by?”</p>

<p>“That’s another question that ain’t needed!” retorted
Ezra defiantly.</p>

<p>“It’s got to be answered, though. Something critical
has happened, Ezra, and we’ve got to take the bull
by the horns.”</p>

<p>“Better take the bull by the tail, doctor. Then you
can let go without hollerin’ fer help.”</p>

<p>“This is no time for joking, Ezra! Something
has happened that, if the captain finds it out, will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
terrible consequences. If he discovers what’s happened,
I can’t answer for the consequences. It might
even kill him, the shock might.”</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;what d’ you mean, sir?” demanded Ezra,
going white. “What <i>are</i> you gammin’ about, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I might as well tell you, directly. Captain Briggs
has just been robbed of more than five hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Robbed! No! Holy haddock! You&mdash;don’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Robbed,” asserted Filhiol. “More than five hundred
dollars are gone from the safe, and&mdash;Hal’s gone,
too.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Filhiol, sir!” exclaimed the old man passionately,
but in a low voice that could not reach the cabin.
“That wun’t go here. You’re company, I know, but
there’s some things that goes too doggone fur. Ef you
mean to let on that Master Hal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The money’s gone, I tell you, and so is Hal. I
know <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I know Master Hal, too!” asseverated
Ezra, manfully standing by his guns, not through any
fear of Hal’s vengeance, but only for the honor of
the house and of the boy he worshipped. “Ef you
mean to accuse him of bein’ a <i>thief</i>, well then, me an’
you has nothin’ more to say. We’re docked, an’ crew
an’ cargo is discharged right now. All done!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Ezra!” commanded Filhiol. “I’m not
making any direct accusation. All I’m saying is that
the money and Hal are both gone.”</p>

<p>“How d’ <i>you</i> know the money’s gone? How come
<i>you</i> to be at the cap’n’s safe an’ money-drawer?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;why&mdash;” stammered Filhiol, taken aback.
“Why, the captain had me open it, to put in some receipts,
and he told me how much he thought was there.
I saw he was mistaken, by more than five hundred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you counted the cap’n’s money, did ye?” Ezra
demanded boldly. “Well, that’s some nerve! In case
it comes to a showdown, where would <i>you</i> fit? Looks
like <i>your</i> fingers might git burned, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“Mine? What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, you was there, wa’n’t ye? An’ Master Hal
wa’n’t, that’s all!” Swiftly Ezra was thinking. The
loss, he knew, could not be kept from Captain Briggs.
And Hal must be protected. Sudden inspiration
dawned on him.</p>

<p>“How much d’ you say is gone?” demanded he.</p>

<p>“Five hundred and some odd dollars.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” said the old man, nodding.
“Them’s the correct figgers, all right enough.”</p>

<p>“How do <i>you</i> know?” exclaimed the doctor, staring.</p>

<p>“Why hadn’t I ought to, when I took that there
money myself?”</p>

<p>“<i>You?</i>”</p>

<p>“Me, sir! I’m the one as stole it, an’ what’s more,
I got it now, up-stairs in my trunk!”</p>

<p>Silence a moment while the doctor peered at him with
wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>“That’s not true, Ezra,” said he at last, meeting the
old man’s defiant look. “You’re lying now to shield
that boy!”</p>

<p>“Lyin’, am I?” And Ezra reddened dully. “Dr.
Filhiol, sir, ef you wa’n’t an old man, an’ hobblin’ on a
cane, them ain’t the words you’d use to me, an’ go
clear!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Ezra,” stammered the doctor.
“I’m not saying it in a derogatory sense.”</p>

<p>“Rogatory or hogatory, don’t make a damn’s odds!
You called me a liar!”</p>

<p>“A noble liar. That kind of a lie is noble, Ezra,
but very foolish. I understand you, all right. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
I say you’re trying to shield Hal, I’ve hit the mark.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t half the shot you think you be, sir!
There’s lots o’ marksmen in this world can’t even make
a gun go off, an’ yet they can’t miss fire in the next
world. You’re one of ’em. I took the money, I tell
ye, an’ I can prove it by showin’ it to you, in two minutes!”</p>

<p>The old man, turning, started for the stairs.</p>

<p>“Where are you going now?” demanded Filhiol.</p>

<p>“To git that there money!”</p>

<p>“Your own savings, no doubt? To shield Hal
with?”</p>

<p>“The money I stole, an’ don’t ye fergit it neither!”
retorted Ezra with a look so menacing that the doctor
ventured no reply. In silence he watched the old man,
wet clothes still clinging to him, plod up the stairs and
disappear.</p>

<p>“Lord, if this isn’t a tangled web,” thought Filhiol,
“what is? I ought never to have come. And yet
I’m needed every minute, if a terrible catastrophe is
to be turned aside!”</p>

<p>His heart contracted at thought of the inevitable
shock to Captain Briggs if he should discover the theft.
Could Ezra conceal it, even with his savings? And, if
he could, would it not be best to let him? Would not
anything be preferable to having the captain’s soul
wrung out of him? Sudden hate against the cause
of all this misery flared up in him.</p>

<p>“Great God!” he muttered. “If I only had that
Hal for a patient, just one hour!”</p>

<p>The footsteps of Ezra, descending again, roused
him. In Ezra’s hand was gripped a roll of bills, old
and tattered for the most part&mdash;a roll that counted
up to some five hundred and thirty dollars, or to within
about forty dollars of every cent Ezra had in the world.
More than fifteen years of hard-earned savings lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that roll. This money Ezra had hastily dug from
under a lot of old clothes in his trunk. And now he
shook it before the eyes of Filhiol, eager to sacrifice it.</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> proof enough fer you now, or ain’t it?”
Ezra exultantly demanded. “Dollar fer dollar, about,
what the cap’n said had oughta be in the safe, an’ ain’t?
Well, does that satisfy ye now?”</p>

<p>Filhiol had no answer. His brain was whirling.
Ezra laughed in his face.</p>

<p>“I got <i>your</i> goat all right, old feller!” gibed he.</p>

<p>“Ezra,” said the doctor slowly, “I don’t understand
this at all. I’m no detective. This is too much for
me. Either you’re a monumental fool or a sublime
hero. Maybe both. I can’t judge. All I want to do
is look out for Captain Briggs. I was his medical officer
in the old days. Now I seem to be back on the
job again. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I’m on the job, too, an’ you’d better keep
out o’ what don’t consarn ye,” menaced Ezra. “Every
man to his job, an’ yours ain’t ratin’ down Master Hal
an’ makin’ a thief of him!”</p>

<p>“All right, Ezra. Put the money in the safe.
Whether it’s yours or not, doesn’t matter now. It
will protect the captain’s peace of mind a little longer,
and that’s the main thing now.”</p>

<p>Ezra nodded. Together they went quietly into the
cabin. Watchfully they observed the captain. Face
to the wall, he was profoundly sleeping.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Filhiol. “You can open the
safe and put the money in.”</p>

<p>Ezra advanced to it, on tiptoe. But Ezra did not
open the safe. Puzzled, he stopped and whispered:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;doggone it, I’ve fergot the combination
now!”</p>

<p>“Have, eh?” asked Filhiol with a sharp look.
“Well then, all you’ve got to do is look at the paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“The&mdash;h-m!”</p>

<p>“Of course you know he keeps it on a paper?” said
the doctor shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, sure! But just now I disremember
where that paper is!”</p>

<p>Filhiol retreated to the dining-room, and beckoned
Ezra to him.</p>

<p>“See here,” said he in a low tone, “this game of
yours is pitifully thin. Why don’t you own up to the
truth? Your loyalty to Hal is wonderful. The recording
angel is writing it all down in his big book;
but you can’t fool anybody. Why, not even a child
would believe you, Ezra, and how can I&mdash;a hard-shelled
old man who’s knocked up and down the seven
seas? You know perfectly well Hal Briggs stole that
money. Own up now!”</p>

<p>The old cook fixed a look of ire on him, and with
clenched fist confronted Filhiol.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said he, “there’s two things makes most
o’ the trouble in this here world. One is evil tongues,
to speak ill o’ folks, an’ the other is evil ears, to listen.
There’s jest two things you can’t do here&mdash;speak ill o’
the cap’n, an’ talk ag’in’ Master Hal. Ef you do, doc&mdash;it
don’t signify ef you <i>be</i> old, I’ll make it damn good
an’ hot fer you! Now, then, I’ve warned you proper.
That’s all&mdash;an’ that’s enough!”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand&mdash;” the doctor was just going
to retort, when a trample of feet on the front porch
brought him to silence.</p>

<p>“There’s Master Hal now!” exclaimed the old cook,
with an expression of dismay. “An’ the money ain’t
back in the safe yit&mdash;an’ Master Hal’s li’ble to wake
the cap’n up!”</p>

<p>“He <i>mustn’t</i> wake him up!” said Filhiol. He
turned, and, hobbling on his cane, started for the front
door to head him off. Too late! Already Hal had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
flung off his cap and, stamping wet feet, had entered
the cabin. The voice of the captain sounded:</p>

<p>“Oh, that you, Hal? God above! but I’m glad to
see you! Come here, boy, come here. I’ve got news
for you. Great, good news!”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="pch">TREACHERY</p>

<p>Still in his dripping raincoat, Hal approached the
berth.</p>

<p>“Whew, but it’s hot and stifling in here, gramp!”
said he. He turned and opened a window, letting the
damp, chill wind draw through. “There, that’s better
now. Well, what’s the big news, eh?”</p>

<p>The old captain regarded him a moment, deeply
moved. In the dining-room, Ezra had hastily stuffed
the bills into his pocket. Now he was retreating to
his galley. Filhiol, undecided what to do, did nothing;
but remained in the front hall.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” repeated Hal. He looked disheveled,
excited. “And what are <i>you</i> in bed for, this
time of day?”</p>

<p>His voice betrayed nothing save curiosity. No sympathy
softened it.</p>

<p>“The doctor made me turn in,” Briggs explained.
“I got wet through, going to town. But it was all for
you, boy. So why should <i>I</i> mind?”</p>

<p>“For me, eh?” demanded Hal. “More trouble?
Enough storm outside, without kicking up any more
rows inside. Some weather, gramp! Some sailing
weather, once a boat got out past the breakwater,
where she could make her manners to the nor’east
blow!” His tongue seemed a trifle thick, but the
captain perceived nothing. “Well, gramp, what was
the idea of going to town an afternoon like this?”</p>

<p>“To set you on the right road again, boy.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
captain raised himself on one elbow, and peered at his
beloved Hal. “To open up a better career for you
than <i>I</i> had. No more sea-life, Hal. There’s been
far too much salt in our blood for generations. It’s
time the Briggs family came ashore. You’ve got better
things ahead of you, now, than fighting the sea.
Peel your wet coat off, Hal, and sit down. You’ll
take cold, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Cold, nothing! This is the kind of weather I
like!”</p>

<p>He pulled up a chair by the berth, and flung himself
down into it, hulking, rude, flushed. In the dim light
old Captain Briggs did not see that telltale flush of
drink. He did not note the sinister exultation in his
grandson’s voice. Nor did he understand the look of
Hal’s searching eyes that tried to fathom whether the
old man as yet had any suspicions of the robbery.</p>

<p>The captain reached out from the bedclothes he
should have kept well over him, and laid his hand on
Hal’s.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, weak and shaken. His forehead
glistened, damp with sweat. “It’s good news. I’ve
been down to see Squire Bean. I’ve paid him the
money for McLaughlin, and got a receipt for it, and
the case against you is all settled. Ended!”</p>

<p>“Is, eh?” demanded Hal, with calculating eyes.
“Great! And the apology stuff is all off, too?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not that. Of course you’ve still got to
apologize to him so all the crew can hear it. But that’s
only a little detail. Any time will do. I know that
after what I’ve sacrificed for you, boy, you’ll be glad to
play the part of a man and go down there and apologize,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Surest little thing you know!” Filhiol heard him
answer, with malice and deceit which Captain Briggs
could not fathom. “The crew will hear from me, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
right. Some of ’em have already. Yes, that’s a fact.
I’ve already apologized to three of ’em. I’ll square
everything, gramp. So that’s all settled. Anything
more?”</p>

<p>“You’re true metal, at heart!” murmured Briggs,
shivering as the draft from the open window struck
him. “Thank God for it! Yes, there’s one more
thing. I’ve sent the money to the college. Sent a
money-order, and got a receipt for that, too. Both receipts
are in the money-drawer, in the safe.”</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i>?” Hal could not dissemble his sudden
anxiety. How much, now, did his grandfather know?
Everything? Suspiciously he blinked at the old man.
“So you put ’em in the safe, did you?” asked he, determined
to force the issue.</p>

<p>“The doctor did for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>he</i> did, did he? H-m! Well, all right.
What next?” Hal stiffened for the blow, but the captain
only said:</p>

<p>“It’s fine to have the whole thing cleaned up, so you
can start on another tack!” The old man smiled with
pitiful affection. “Everything’s coming out right,
after all. You don’t know how wonderfully happy I
am to-day. It won’t be long before I have you back in
some other college again.”</p>

<p>“The devil it won’t!” thought Hal. The doctor,
at the rear of the hallway, felt a clutch on his arm.
There stood old Ezra.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he whispered in a way that meant business,
“you ain’t goin’ to stand here listenin’ to ’em, this
way!”</p>

<p>“I’m not, eh?” And Filhiol blinked astonishment.
“Why not?”</p>

<p>“There’s ten reasons. One is, because I ain’t goin’
to let you, an’ the other nine is because I ain’t goin’
to let you! I wouldn’t do it myself, an’ <i>you</i> ain’t goin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>’
to, neither. Will you clear out o’ here, peaceful, or be
you goin’ to make me matt onta you an’ carry you
out?”</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated. Ezra added:</p>

<p>“Now, doc, don’t you git me harr’d up, or there’ll
be stormy times!”</p>

<p>Filhiol yielded. He followed Ezra to the galley,
where the old man practically interned him. Inwardly
he cursed this development. What might not happen,
were the captain now to discover the loss of the money
while Hal was there? But to argue with Ezra was
hopeless. Filhiol settled down by the stove and resigned
himself to moody ponderings.</p>

<p>“This summer, take things easy,” the captain was
saying, with indulgence. “In the fall you’ll enter
some other college and win honors as we all expect you
to. So you’ll be glad to go, won’t you, Hal?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to <i>go</i>, all right!”</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” smiled the captain. He got out of
bed in his bathrobe, slid his feet into slippers, and
stood there a moment, looking at Hal.</p>

<p>“Boy,” said he, “on the way back from town I
made up my mind to do the right thing by you, to give
you something every young fellow along the coast
ought to have. You were asking me for a boat, and I
refused you. I was wrong. Nothing finer, after all,
than a little cruising up and down the shore. I’ve
changed my mind, Hal.” He laid an affectionate hand
on the boy’s shoulder. “I’m going to give you the
money for Gordon’s <i>Kittiwink</i>.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” grunted Hal, standing up in vast astonishment
and anxiety.</p>

<p>“Take the money, Hal, and buy your heart’s dearest
wish,” said the old captain. “It’ll maybe pinch me,
for a while, but you’re all I’ve got to love and some
way I can rub along. If I can give you a happy summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the few hundred dollars won’t mean much, after
all. So, boy, get yourself the boat. Why, what’s the
matter? You look kind of flabbergasted, Hal. Aren’t
you glad and thankful?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, I am!” the boy rallied
with a strong effort. “It’s great of you, gramp!
But&mdash;can you afford it?”</p>

<p>“That’s for me to judge, Hal,” smiled the captain,
shivering as the draft struck him. He turned towards
the safe. Hal detained him with a hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t give it to me just yet,” said he, anxiously.
“Wait a little!”</p>

<p>“No, no, that wouldn’t be the same at all,” insisted
Briggs. “I want you to have this present now, to-day,
to make you always remember your fresh start in life.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, gramp!” exclaimed Hal. “I don’t
feel right about it, and&mdash;and I can’t accept it. I
want to make a really new start. To make my own
way&mdash;be a man, not a dependent! Please don’t spoil
everything the first minute by doing this!”</p>

<p>“But, Hal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know how you feel,” said the boy, with feverish
energy. “But I’ve got feelings, too, and now you’re
hurting them. Please don’t, grandfather! Please
let me stand on my own feet, and be a man!”</p>

<p>Old Briggs, who had with feeble steps made his way
half across the floor, turned and looked at Hal with
eyes of profound affection.</p>

<p>“God bless you, boy!” said he with deep emotion.
“Do you really mean that?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do! Come, get back into bed now.
You’re taking cold there. Get back before you have
another chill!”</p>

<p>Anxiously he led the captain back towards the berth.
His touch was complete betrayal. Into his voice he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
forced a tone of caressing sincerity, music to the old
man’s ears.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned a great deal the last day or two,” said
he, as with traitor solicitude he put the captain into his
berth, and covered him up. “I’ve been learning some
great lessons. What you said to me up there among
the graves, has opened my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Bless God for that!” And in the captain’s eyes
tears glistened. “That’s wonderful for me to hear, in
this room where all those relics of the past&mdash;that kris
and everything&mdash;can’t help reminding me of other
and worse days. A wonderful, blessèd thing to hear!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it is, gramp,” said Hal, “and it’s
every bit true. On my honor as a gentleman, it is!
From to-day I’m going to stand on my own feet and
be a man. You don’t know what I’ve been doing already
to give myself a start in life, but if you did,
you’d be wonderfully surprised. What I’m still going
to do will certainly surprise you more!”</p>

<p>“Lord above, Hal, but you’re the right stuff after
all!” exclaimed Captain Briggs, the tears now coursing
freely. “Oh, if you could only realize what all
this means for me after all the years of sacrifice and
hopes and fears. We came pretty nigh shipwreck on
the reefs, didn’t we, boy? But it’s all right. It’s all
right now at last!”</p>

<p>“It surely is. And I’m certainly going to surprise
you and Laura and everybody.”</p>

<p>“Kneel down beside me, just a minute, boy, and
then I’ll go to sleep again.”</p>

<p>Hal, making a wry face to himself, knelt by the bedside.
Old Briggs, with one arm, drew him close. The
other hand stroked back Hal’s thick, wet hair with a
touch that love made gentle as a woman’s.</p>

<p>“This is a day of days to me,” he whispered. “A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
wonderful blessèd day! God guide and keep you, forever
and ever. Amen!”</p>

<p>He sighed deeply and relaxed. His eyes drooped
shut. Hal pulled the blankets up and got to his feet,
peering down with eyes of malice.</p>

<p>A moment he stood there while the wind gusted
against the house, the rain sprayed along the porch,
and branches whipped the roof.</p>

<p>Then, with a smile of infernal triumph, he turned.</p>

<p>“Cinch!” he muttered, as he left the cabin and made
his way up-stairs. “Why, it’s like taking candy from
a baby. He’ll sleep for hours now. But won’t it jar
the old geezer when his pipe goes out, to-night? Just
won’t it, though?”</p>

<p>With silent laughter Hal reached his room, where,
without delay, he started on his final preparations for
events now swiftly impending.</p>

<p>Over all the heavens&mdash;a blind, gray face of wrath&mdash;seemed
peering down. But on that face was now
no laughter.</p>

<p>Even for Vishnu the Avenger some things must be
too terrible.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DOCTOR SPEAKS</p>

<p>Hal had been at work five minutes when he was
startled by a sharp knock. The door was flung open
in no gentle manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Filhiol, leaning on his cane, confronted him.
Hal knew trouble lay dead ahead. Standing there in
shirt-sleeves, with litter and confusion of packing all
about, and two half-filled suit-cases on a couple of
chairs, Hal frowned angrily.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a nerve to butt in like this!” he
growled. “What d’ you want now?”</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got no time to waste on nonsense!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got time to talk to me, and talk to me
you’re going to,” returned the doctor. “This is no
nonsense.” He came in and shut the door. The scent
of liquor met his nostrils. “A young man who’s been
responsible for the things you have, has certainly got
time to answer me!”</p>

<p>Awed by the physician’s cold determination, and
with fear at heart&mdash;for might not Filhiol know about
the stolen money?&mdash;Hal moderated his defiance.
This old man must be kept quiet for a few hours yet;
Hal must have a few hours.</p>

<p>“You’re assuming too much authority for a
stranger,” said Hal, sullenly. “I never knew before
that a gentleman would interfere in this way.”</p>

<p>“Probably not, when dealing <i>with</i> a gentleman,” retorted
Filhiol, “but this case is different. My acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with your grandfather dates back more
than half a century, and when my duty requires me to
speak, no young bully like you is going to stop me.
No, you needn’t double your fist, or look daggers,
because I’m not in the least afraid of you, sir. And
I’m not going to mince matters with you. What did
you do with the captain’s five hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>Hal felt himself lost. He had effectually closed
Ezra’s mouth, but now here stood the doctor, accusing
him. One moment he had the impulse to do murder;
but now that all things were in readiness for his flight,
he realized violence would be a fatal error. His only
hope lay in diplomacy.</p>

<p>“What five hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“You know very well what five hundred! Come,
what did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Really, Dr. Filhiol, this is a most astonishing accusation!”
said Hal. “<i>I</i> don’t know anything about
any five hundred. Is that amount gone?”</p>

<p>“You know very well it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of the kind! How should I?”</p>

<p>“You can’t fool me, young man!” exclaimed the
doctor hotly. He raised his cane in menace.</p>

<p>“Put that stick down, sir,” said Hal in a wicked
voice. “No man living can threaten me with a stick
and get way with it. I tell you I don’t know anything
about the money! I’ve been out of this house for
some time, and you and Ezra have been here. Now
you tell me there’s five hundred dollars gone. By
God, if you weren’t an old man and a guest, you’d
eat your words damned quick!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;you&mdash;” stammered the doctor, outgeneralled.</p>

<p>“I’ve wasted enough time on you now!” Hal flung
at him. “It’s time for you to be going.” He gripped
Filhiol by the wrist with a vise-pressure that bruised.
“And one thing more, you!” he growled. “You’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
just better not go stirring up gramp against me, or
accusing me to Ezra. It won’t be healthy for you to
go accusing me of what you can’t prove, you prying
gray ferret!”</p>

<p>“Ezra knows all about it already!” retorted the
doctor, tempted to smash at that insolent, evil face with
his cane.</p>

<p>“Knows it, does he?” Hal could not repress a
start.</p>

<p>“Yes, he does. He’s already sworn to a falsehood
to me, to save your worthless hide!”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean he’s accused himself of the theft, you
scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“Let him, then! If the shoe fits him, let him put it
on!”</p>

<p>“Oh, let him, eh? Yes, and let him beggar himself.
Let him try to get his pitiful life-savings back into the
safe in time to save you! A man who’ll stand by and
let a poor old servant, more faithful than a dog, bankrupt
himself to cover up a sneaking crime&mdash;a man
who’ll pack up and run away&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough o’ you!” snarled Hal. He
pushed the doctor out into the hall. “Ezra’s admitted
it, and gramp wouldn’t believe I did it, even if he saw
the money in my hand. Get out now, and if you cross
my path again, look out!”</p>

<p>The doctor met his threat unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said he, “I sailed harder seas, in the
old times, than any seas to-day. I sailed with your
grandfather when he was a bucko of the old school,
and though we didn’t usually agree and once I nearly
shot him, I never knuckled under. Maybe the bullet
that just missed cutting off your grandfather’s life is
still waiting for its billet. Maybe that’s part of the
curse on <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes were cold steel as he peered at the menacing,
huge figure of Hal.</p>

<p>“Be careful, sir,” he added. “Be very careful how
you raise your hand against a man like me!”</p>

<p>“If I ever <i>do</i> raise my hand, there’ll be no more
threats of shooting left in you!” Hal flung at him.
With a sudden flare of rage he pushed old Filhiol
through the door and turned the lock. The doctor
stumbled, dropped his cane and fetched up against the
balustrade of the stairs. Ashen and trembling he clung
there a moment. Then he raised his shaking fist to
heaven.</p>

<p>“Oh, God,” he prayed, “God, give me power to
stamp this viper’s head before it poisons the captain&mdash;before
it poisons Laura and old Ezra&mdash;the town,
the very air, the world! God, give me strength to
stamp it in the dust!”</p>

<p>Within the room sounded the tread of Hal, going,
coming as he growled to himself, packed up his things
for flight.</p>

<p>“Aye, go!” thought the doctor. “Go, and devil
take you! Go, and if there’s any curse, carry it with
you to the end of the world!”</p>

<p>The doctor realized that nothing better than this
departure could happen. The boy would undoubtedly
come to his end before long in some drunken
brawl. Sooner or later he would meet his match;
would get killed, or would do murder and would finish
on the gallows or in the chair. That over-mastering
physical strength, backed by the arrogance of conscious
power, could not fail to ruin him.</p>

<p>“The world will soon settle with you, Hal Briggs,”
said he, as he made his way down-stairs. “Soon settle,
and for good. It will break the captain’s heart to
have you go, but it would break it worse to have you
stay. This is best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Calmer now, he stopped a moment at the cabin door
to assure himself Captain Briggs was sleeping.</p>

<p>“Lord!” he thought. “I hope Hal gets away before
the old man wakes up. It will spare us a terrible
scene&mdash;a scene that might cost the captain his
life!”</p>

<p>His eye caught a glint of red. Oddly enough, firelight,
reflected from one of the captain’s brass instruments,
ticked just a tiny point of crimson on the blade
of the old kris.</p>

<p>The doctor shuddered and passed on, failing to notice
the open window in the room. He felt oppressed
and stifling. Air! he must have air! He got into a
coat hanging on the rack, put on his hat and limped
out upon the porch.</p>

<p>Up and down walked Dr. Filhiol a few times, trying
to shake off heavy bodings of evil. A curious little
figure he made, withered, bent, but with the fires of invincible
determination burning in his eyes. The time
he had passed at Snug Haven had brought back his
fighting spirit. Dr. Filhiol seemed quite other from the
meek and inoffensive old man who had so short a time
ago driven up to the captain’s gate. Even the grip
of his hand on his cane was different. Hal Briggs
might well look out for him now, if any turn of chance
should put him into Filhiol’s power.</p>

<p>The doctor paused at last on the sheltered side of the
porch, near the captain’s windows and away from that
side of the house where Hal’s room was located.
More heavily than ever the rain was sheeting down,
and from the shore a long thunder told of sea charges
broken against the impenetrable defenses of the rocks.</p>

<p>All at once the doctor saw a figure coming along the
road, head down to wind and rain&mdash;a figure in a
mackintosh, with a little white hat drawn down over
thick hair&mdash;the figure of a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Astonished that a woman should be abroad in such
weather, he peered more closely. The woman came to
the side gate, stopped there, and, holding her hat and
flying hair with one hand, looked anxiously over the
hedge at Snug Haven.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Filhiol recognized her.</p>

<p>“Laura! What the devil now?” said he.</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to read her thought, that she was
afraid of being seen by Hal, but that she greatly desired
speech of some one else. With raised hand he beckoned
her; and she, perceiving him, came quickly
through the gate to the porch.</p>

<p>Wild-tossed and disheveled she was with frightened
eyes and wistful, pleading face. Filhiol’s heart
yearned to her, filled with pity.</p>

<p>“You’re Laura, aren’t you?” asked the doctor, taking
her hand and steadying her a little. “Laura
Maynard? Yes? I’m Dr. Filhiol, a very old and
confidential friend of the captain’s. What can I do to
help you?”</p>

<p>“The captain!” she panted, almost spent with exertion
and chill. “I’ve got to&mdash;see the captain right
away!”</p>

<p>“My dear, that’s quite impossible,” said Filhiol,
drawing her more into shelter. “He’s asleep, worn
out with exertions concerning Hal. You’ve come to
see him about Hal. Yes, I thought so. Well, the captain
can’t be disturbed now, for any reason whatever.
But you can tell me, Laura. Perhaps I may do quite
as well.”</p>

<p>She pondered a moment, then asked with a strong
effort: “Where is Hal now?”</p>

<p>“Up-stairs. Do you want to see him?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” she shuddered. “God forbid! But&mdash;oh,
doctor, please let me see the captain, if only for
a minute!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s ill, I tell you, Laura.”</p>

<p>“Not seriously?” she asked with sudden anxiety.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not yet, but we can’t take any chances.”</p>

<p>The girl took his hand in a trembling clasp.</p>

<p>“Don’t let anything happen to the captain!” she exclaimed,
her rain-wet face very beautiful in its anxiety.
“Oh, doctor, he’s the most wonderful old man in the
world, the finest, the noblest! Nothing, nothing must
happen to <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>“Nothing shall, if I can help it. If I can stand between
him and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And Hal?” she queried. “Yes, I understand.
What a terrible curse to love a man like that!”</p>

<p>“The captain must soon find it so,” said Filhiol.
“Every one who loves that boy has got to suffer
grievously. You, too, Laura,” he added. “You
must steel your heart to many things. The captain
will soon need all your strength and consolation.”</p>

<p>“You know the bad news, too?”</p>

<p>“I know much bad news. But if you’ve got any
more, tell me!”</p>

<p>“You know about the fight he had this afternoon
and about his buying Gordon’s boat, the <i>Kittiwink</i>?”</p>

<p>“No. Nothing about that. But I know Hal’s
packing some things now to make what they call a
getaway. And&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you’re not going to stop him?” exclaimed the
girl, clutching his arm. “You’re <i>not</i>?”</p>

<p>“Shhh, my dear!” warned Filhiol. “We mustn’t
wake the captain in there! Stop Hal? No, no!
Nothing better could happen than to have him go before
he does murder in this town.”</p>

<p>“He almost did murder this afternoon! He ran
into three of McLaughlin’s men down at Hadlock’s
Cove, and they twitted him about apologizing to McLaughlin.
Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more,” interrupted the doctor, raising his
hand. “I understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor, but the news has spread, and the rest
of the crew have sworn vengeance on Hal. They’ll
surely kill him, doctor!”</p>

<p>“God grant they may!” the doctor thought, but
what he said was:</p>

<p>“The quicker he goes, then, the better.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t there any way to bring him to reason,
doctor? To make him like other men? To save
him?”</p>

<p>“I see none,” Filhiol answered. He pondered a
moment while the rain-drums rolled their tattoos on the
roof of the porch and the sea thundered. “The curse,
the real curse on that boy, is his unbridled temper, his
gorilla-like strength. His strength has unsettled his
judgment and his will. Ordinary men rely on their
brains, and have to be decent. Hal, with those battering-ram
fists, thinks he can smash down everything,
and win, like one of Nietzsche’s supermen. If something
could drain him of strength, and weaken and
humble him, it might be the salvation of him yet.”</p>

<p>“God grant it might!”</p>

<p>“You still love him, girl?” asked Filhiol, tenderly
as a father. “In spite of everything?”</p>

<p>“I love the good in him, and there’s so wonderfully
much!”</p>

<p>“I understand, my dear. Just now, the bad is all
predominant. There’s nothing to do but let him go,
Laura. Because&mdash;he’s determined to go, at all costs.
Where, I don’t know, or how.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> know how!” exclaimed the girl. “He’s bought
the <i>Kittiwink</i> and laid in supplies. My father’s in the
boat-brokerage business, and he’s got word of it.”</p>

<p>“Bought it?” interrupted the doctor. “How?
On credit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, cash. He paid four hundred and seventy-five
dollars for it, in bills.”</p>

<p>“He did? By&mdash;h-m!”</p>

<p>“What is it, doctor? Where could Hal get all that
money? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“I know only too well, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Tell me!” she exclaimed eagerly, and took him by
the hand.</p>

<p>So absorbed were they that neither heard a slight
sound from the captain’s window, like the quick intake
of a breath. How could they know the old man
had wakened, had heard their voices; how could they
know he had arisen, and, all trembling and weak, was
now standing hidden inside the window, listening to
words that tore the heart clean out of him?</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAPTAIN SEES</p>

<p>Anguished the captain listened. He heard Laura
question:</p>

<p>“Where did Hal get that money? Where’s he going,
and what does it all mean?” Her trembling voice
echoed its woe in the captain’s tortured soul.</p>

<p>“Where Hal’s going I don’t know, Laura,” the doctor
answered, “except it’s evident he’s planning to escape
from here for good. He may be bound for the
South Seas with some crazy, wild notion of a free-and-easy
buccaneering life. Hal’s going, and it’s evident
he doesn’t intend to come back. The best thing we
can do is just <i>let</i> him go. It seems hard, but there’s
no other way. As for where he got the money&mdash;well&mdash;Why
not speak plainly to you? It’s the best
way now.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then!”</p>

<p>Within his cabin, old Captain Briggs clutched his
hands together in agony. But still he held himself
that he might stand there and hear this revelation to
the end.</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> tell you, Laura. The money&mdash;there’s only
one place where it could have come from.”</p>

<p>“The captain? He gave it to him?”</p>

<p>“It came from the captain, but not as a gift.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;don’t mean&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly hard to speak that word, Laura, isn’t
it?” pitied the old doctor. “Yet the money’s gone
from the captain’s safe. Ezra accuses himself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that’s mere nonsense. Every finger of certainty points
to Hal Briggs as a thief. And not only an ordinary
thief, but one who’s taken advantage of every
bond of confidence and affection, most brutally to betray
the man who loves him better than life itself!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you&mdash;you can’t mean <i>that</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t mean anything else. Hal’s up-stairs
now, unless he’s already gone. He’s trying to
escape before the captain wakes up.”</p>

<p>“And you’re not going to stop him?”</p>

<p>“Never! You mustn’t, either!”</p>

<p>“But this will break the old man’s heart&mdash;the biggest,
most loving heart in the world! This will kill
him!”</p>

<p>“Even that would be less cruel than to have Hal
stay, and have him torture the old captain.”</p>

<p>“And there’s nothing you can do? Nothing you’ll
let <i>me</i> do?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing any one can do now, but God.
And God holds aloof, these days.”</p>

<p>For a minute Laura peered up at him, letting the full
import of his words sink into her dazed brain. Then,
sensing the tragic inevitability of what must be, she
turned, ran down the steps and along the rain-swept
path.</p>

<p>He dared not call after her, to bid her take no desperate
measures, for fear of waking the captain&mdash;the
captain, at that very moment shivering inside the window,
transfixed by spikes of suffering that nailed him
to his cross of Calvary. In silence he watched her,
storm-driven like a wraith, grow dim through the rain
till she vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>Alone, Dr. Filhiol sank heavily into a wet chair.
There he remained, thinking deep and terrible things
that wring the heart of man.</p>

<p>And the captain, what of him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Dazed, staggered, he groped toward the desk.
From the drawer he took the slip of paper bearing the
combination. With an effort that taxed all his
strength he opened the safe, opened the money-compartment.
His trembling fingers caught up the few
remaining bills there.</p>

<p>“God above!” he gulped.</p>

<p>Then all at once a change, a swift metamorphosis of
wrath and outraged love swept over him. He seemed
to freeze into a stern, avenging figure, huge of shoulder,
hard of fist. The bulk of him loomed vast, in
that enfolding bathrobe like a Roman patrician’s toga,
as he strode through the door and up the stairs.</p>

<p>Silent and grim, he struck Hal’s door with his fist.
The door resisted. One lunge of the shoulder, and the
lock burst.</p>

<p>Hal stood there in corduroy trousers, heavy gray
reefer and oilskin hat. Two strapped suit-cases stood
by the bureau. Over the floor, the bed, lay a litter of
discarded clothes and papers.</p>

<p>“What the hell!” cried the thief, clenching angry
fists.</p>

<p>“You, sir!” exclaimed old Captain Briggs, in a
voice the boy had never yet heard. “Stand where you
are! I have to speak with you!”</p>

<p>Not even the effrontery of Hal’s bold eyes could
quite meet that blue, piercing look. Had the old man,
he wondered, a revolver? Was he minded now to kill?
In that terrible and accusing face, he saw what Alpheus
Briggs had been in the old, barbarous days. The brute
in him recognized the dormant passions of his grandfather,
now rekindling. And, though he tried to mask
his soul, the fear in it spied through his glance.</p>

<p>“You snake!” the captain flung at him. “You
lying Judas!”</p>

<p>“Go easy there!” Hal menaced. That he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
drinking was obvious. The scent of liquor filled the
room, abomination in the old man’s nostrils. “Go
easy! I’m not taking any such talk from any man,
even if he is my grandfather!”</p>

<p>“You’ll take all I have to say, and you can lay to
that, sir!” retorted the old man. Toward Hal he advanced,
fists doubled. The boy cast about him for
some weapon. Not for all his strength did he dare
stand against this overpowering old man.</p>

<p>Below, on the porch, the doctor had heard sounds of
war, and had pegged into the hall at his best speed.
There he met Ezra, who had just come from the cabin.</p>

<p>“Great gulls! The safe’s open&mdash;the cap’n&mdash;knows!
Hell’s loose now!” Ezra gasped.</p>

<p>He made for the stairs. The doctor tried to clutch
him back.</p>

<p>“No use, Ezra! Too late&mdash;you can’t stop it now
with all that nonsense about your being the thief!”</p>

<p>“Let me up them stairs, damn you!”</p>

<p>“Never! They’ve got to settle this themselves.
You’ll only make things worse!”</p>

<p>With an oath, a violent wrench, Ezra tore himself
away, and scrambled up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs! Hal!” he shouted, torn by conflicting
loves. “Wait on, both o’ ye. <i>I</i> done it&mdash;<i>nobody
but me</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There now, how does <i>that</i> strike you?” sneered
Hal, respited by the shock of this self-accusation that
dropped the captain’s fists. “The son-of-a-sea-cook
owns up to it, himself!”</p>

<p>“Me, me, nobody but me!” vociferated Ezra, who
had now reached the room. He clawed at the captain’s
arm. “Not him, cap’n! <i>Me!</i>”</p>

<p>“If that’s true, Ezra, how the devil does Hal, here,
know what you’re talking about, so slick?”</p>

<p>“Ezra lent me five hundred, when it comes to that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>”
put in Hal, “and told me it was his savings. But I
see now&mdash;he stole it, the damned, black-hearted thief!
Didn’t you, Ezra?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sure! Cap’n, you listen to me now. Hal,
he never&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ezra,” said old Briggs, holding his rage in check,
“you’re wonderful!” He laid a hand of affection on
the shoulder of the trembling old man. “It’s your
heart and soul that’s speaking falsehood&mdash;falsehood
more white and shining than God’s truth. But I can’t
take your word, given to shield this serpent we’ve been
nursing in our bosom. I know all about everything
now. I know why Hal robbed me.”</p>

<p>“Like hell you do!” the boy blared out.</p>

<p>“Yes, even the name of the very boat he’s bought
with my hard-saved money. Money that was meant
to help him up and on again. It’s no use your lying to
me, Ezra.” He pointed a steady, accusing finger.
“There’s the thief, Ezra, standing right before you&mdash;standing
there for the last time he’ll ever stand under
this roof of mine, so help me God!”</p>

<p>“Cap’n, cap’n,” implored the old man sinking to his
knees, hands clasped, face streaming tears. “Don’t
say that! Oh, Lord, don’t, don’t say that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t give a damn <i>what</i> the old stiff says now,”
sneered Hal, picking up his baggage. His red face
was brutalized with rage and drink. “Let him go to
it. He said a mouthful when he said I grabbed the
coin. Sure I did&mdash;and I’m only sorry it wasn’t more.
Wish I’d grabbed it all! I’d like to have cleaned the
old tightwad for a decent roll, while I was at it!”</p>

<p>“Hal! Master Hal!”</p>

<p>The doctor, listening from below, quivered with
rage, but held himself in check. What, after all, could
his weak body accomplish? And as for speech, that
was not needed now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get out o’ my way, the pair o’ you, and let me blow
out o’ this namby-pamby, Sunday-school dump!”
snarled Hal, shouldering forward. “I’m quitting. I
told you yesterday I was sick of all this grandpa’s-darling
stuff. If I can’t get out and <i>live</i>, I’ll cash in
my checks. College&mdash;apologies&mdash;white flannels&mdash;<i>urrgh!</i>”</p>

<p>The growl in his deep chest and sinewed throat was
that of a wolf. Silent, cold, unmoved now, the old
captain studied him.</p>

<p>“None o’ that for mine, thanks!” Hal threw at him
with insolence supreme. “Wait till I catch McLaughlin!
<i>I’ll</i> apologize to him! Say! I’ve already apologized
to three of his men, and Mac’ll get it, triple-extract.
And then I’ll blow. I’ve got a classy boat that
can walk <i>some</i>, and let ’em try to stop me, if they
want to. I’m not afraid of you, or any man in this
town, or in the world!”</p>

<p>He dropped one of the suit-cases, raised his right
arm and swelled the formidable biceps, glorying in the
brute power of his arm, his trip-hammer fist.</p>

<p>“Afraid? Not while I’ve got this! Go ahead and
try to get me arrested, if you think fit. It’ll take
more than Albert Mills to pinch me, or Squire Bean to
hold me for trial&mdash;it’ll take more than any jail in
this town to keep <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>“Now I’ve said all I’m going to, except that I took
the coin. Yes, I took it. And I’ll take more wherever
I find it. Money, booze, women&mdash;I’ll take ’em all.
They’re mine, if I can get ’em. That’s all. To hell
with everything that stands in my way! You two get
out of it now before I throw you out!”</p>

<p>He brutally struck the kneeling old Ezra down and
picked up the suit-cases. The captain quivered with the
strain of holding his hand from slaughter, and stood
aside. Not one word did he speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal blundered out into the passageway, and, panting
with rage, started to descend the stairs.</p>

<p>Old Ezra, crawling on hands and knees, tried to follow.</p>

<p>“Hal! Master Hal, come back! I got money!
<i>I’ll&mdash;I’ll pay!</i>”</p>

<p>The captain lifted him, held him with an arm of
steel.</p>

<p>“Silence, Ezra! Remember, we’re not children.
We’re old deep-water sailormen, you and I. This is
mutiny. The boy has chosen. It’s all over.”</p>

<p>Ezra sank into a chair, covered his face and burst
into convulsive sobs, rocking himself to and fro in the
excess of his grief.</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs walked to the top of the stairs, and
silently watched Hal descend. At the bottom, Dr. Filhiol
confronted the swearing, murderous fellow. He,
too, kept silence. Only he stood back a little, avoiding
Hal as if the very breath of him were poison.</p>

<p>Hal flung a sneer at him with bared teeth, and paused
a moment at the door leading into the cabin. A
thought came to his brain, crazed with whisky, rage
and the obscure hereditary curse that lay upon him.
Something seemed whispering a command to him,
irrational enough, yet wholly compelling.</p>

<p>To the fireplace Hal strode, snatched down the kris,
opened one of the suit-cases, and threw the weapon in.
He locked the case again, and slouched out on to the
piazza, defiantly and viciously.</p>

<p>“Might come handy, that knife, if the fists didn’t
get away with the goods,” he muttered. “Take it
along, anyhow!”</p>

<p>The Airedale, hearing Hal’s step, got up and fawned
against him. Hal, with an obscene oath, kicked the
animal.</p>

<p>“<i>Get</i> out o’ my way, you&mdash;” he growled. The dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
yelping, still cringed after him as he descended the
steps. Mad with the blind passion that kills, Hal flung
down his suit-cases, snatched up the dog and dashed it
down on the steps with horrible force.</p>

<p>“Damn you, don’t you touch that dog again!”
shouted old Dr. Filhiol, hobbling out the door.</p>

<p>He brandished his cane. In his pale face flamed
holy rage. With a boisterous, horrible laugh, Hal
snatched the cane from him, snapped it with one flirt
of his huge hands, and threw the pieces into the doctor’s
face.</p>

<p>The dog, still crying out with the pain of a broken
leg, tried to drag himself to Hal. Another oath, a
kick, and Ruddy sprawled along the porch.</p>

<p>“I’ve fixed <i>you</i> a while, you fossil quack!” gibed
Hal at the doctor. “Maybe you’ll butt in again where
you’re not wanted! Lucky for you I’m in a hurry
now, or I’d do a better job!”</p>

<p>Again Hal picked up his cases, and strode down the
walk, against the rain and gale. At the gate he paused,
triumphant.</p>

<p>“To hell with this place!” he cried. “To hell with
the whole business and with all o’ you!”</p>

<p>Then he passed through the gate, along the hedge,
and vanished in the boisterous storm.</p>

<p>Up in Hal’s room, old Ezra was still convulsed with
senile grief. The captain, his face white and lined,
had sunk down on the bed and with vacant eyes was
staring at the books and papers strewn there in confusion.</p>

<p>All at once his attention focused on a sheet of paper
whereon a few words seemed vividly to stand out. He
advanced a shaking hand, picked up the paper and
read:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">The curse must be fulfilled, to the last breath, for by
Shiva and the Trimurthi, what is written is written. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
if he through whom the curse descendeth on another is
stricken to horror and to death, then the Almighty Vishnu,
merciful, closes that page. And he who through another’s
sin was accursed, is cleansed. Thus may the curse be fulfilled.
But always one of two must die. <i>Tuan Allah poonia
krajah!</i> It is the work of the Almighty One! One of two
must die!</p>

<p class="p1">Carefully the old man read the words. Once more
he read them. Then, with a smile of strange comprehension
and great joy, he nodded.</p>

<p>“One of two&mdash;one of two must die!” said he.
“Thank God, I understand! <i>At last&mdash;thank God!</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">CAPTAIN BRIGGS FINDS THE WAY</p>

<p>The full significance of the curse burning deep into
his brain, old Captain Briggs sat there on the bed a
moment longer, his eyes fixed on the slip of paper.
Then, with a new and very strange expression, as of a
man who suddenly has understood, has chosen and is
determined, he carefully folded the paper and thrust it
into the pocket of his bathrobe. He stood up, peered
at Ezra, advanced and laid a hand upon the old man’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ezra,” said he in a deep voice, “there’s times when
men have got to <i>be</i> men, and this is one of ’em. You
and I have gone some pretty rough voyages in years
past. I don’t recall that either of us was ever afraid or
refused duty in any wind or weather. We aren’t going
to now. Whatever’s duty, that’s what we’re going to
do. It’ll maybe lead me to a terribly dark port, but if
that’s where I’ve got to go, as a good seaman, so be it.</p>

<p>“And now,” he added in another tone, “now that’s
all settled, and no more to be said about it.” Affectionately
he patted the shoulder of the broken-hearted
Ezra. “Come, brace up now; brace up!”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Briggs, sir,” choked Ezra, distraught with
grief, “you ain’t goin’ to believe what Master Hal said,
be you? He accused himself o’ stealin’ that there
money, to pertect me. It was really <i>me</i> as done it,
sir, not <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss that any more, Ezra,” the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
answered, with a smile of deep affection. “It doesn’t
much signify. There’s so much more to all this than
just one particular case of theft. You don’t understand,
Ezra. Come now, sir; pull yourself together!
No more of this!”</p>

<p>“But ain’t you goin’ to do anythin’ to bring him
back, cap’n?” asked the old man. He got up and
faced the captain with a look of grief and pain.
“That there boy of ourn, oh, he can’t be let go to the
devil this way! Ain’t there nothin’ you can do to save
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ezra, there is.”</p>

<p>“Praise God fer that, cap’n! You hadn’t ought to
be too hard on Hal. You an’ me, we’re old, but we’d
oughta try an’ understand a young un. Young folks
is always stickin’ up the circus-bills along the road o’
life, an’ old uns is always comin’ along an’ tearin’ ’em
down; an’ that ain’t right, cap’n. You an’ me has got
to understand!”</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly,” smiled the captain, his
eyes steady and calm. “I know exactly what I’ve got
to do.”</p>

<p>“An’ you’ll do it?” Ezra’s trembling eagerness
was pitiful. “You’re going’ to do it, cap’n?”</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs nodded. His voice blended with a
sudden furious gust of wind as he answered:</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it, Ezra. I’m surely going to.”</p>

<p>“An’ what <i>is</i> it?” insisted Ezra. “Run after him
an’ bring him back?”</p>

<p>“Bring him back. That’s just it.”</p>

<p>“Praise the Lord!” The old man’s eyes were wet.
“When? When you goin’ to do it?”</p>

<p>“Very soon, now.”</p>

<p>“You got to hurry, cap’n. We mustn’t let anythin’
happen to our Hal. He’s run kinda wild, mebbe, but
he’s everythin’ we got to love. Ef you can git him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
back agin, we’ll be so doggone good to him he’ll <i>hafta</i>
do better. But you mustn’t lose no time. Ef he gits
aboard that there <i>Kittiwink</i> an’ tries to make sail out
through the Narrers, he’s like as not to git stove up on
Geyser.”</p>

<p>The captain smiled as he made answer:</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t lose any unnecessary time, Ezra. But I
can’t do it all in a moment. And you must let me do
this in my own way.”</p>

<p>The old man peered up at him through tears.</p>

<p>“You know best how to chart this course, now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I do. To save that boy, I’ve got to
make a journey, and I’ll need a little time to get ready.
But just the minute I <i>am</i> ready, I’ll go. You can depend
on that!”</p>

<p>“A journey? I’ll go too!”</p>

<p>“No, Ezra, this is a journey I must take all alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know best, cap’n,” the old fellow assented.
“But ef you need any help, call on!”</p>

<p>“I will, Ezra. Now go to your room and rest.
You’re badly used up. There’s nothing you can do to
help, just now.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you be wantin’ me to pack y’r duffel?
An’ rig Bucephalus?”</p>

<p>“When I want you, I’ll let you know,” smiled
Briggs. With one hand still on the old man’s shoulder,
his other hand took Ezra’s in a strong clasp.</p>

<p>“Ezra,” said he, “you’ve always stood by, through
thick and thin, and I know you will now. You’ve been
the most loyal soul in this whole world. No needle
ever pointed north half as constant as you’ve pointed
toward your duty by Hal and me. You’re a man,
Ezra, <i>a man</i>&mdash;and I’m not ashamed to say I love you
for it!”</p>

<p>His grip tightened on the old man’s hand. For a
moment he looked square into Ezra’s wondering, half-frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
eyes. Then he loosened his grasp, turned
and walked from the room.</p>

<p>Along the hall he went, and down the stairs. His
face, calm, beatified, seemed shining with an inner light
that ennobled its patriarchal features.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” he whispered, “for light to see my
duty, and for strength to do it!”</p>

<p>As he reached the bottom of the stairs, the front door
opened, and Dr. Filhiol staggered in, admitting a furious
gust of wind and rain. With great difficulty he
was managing himself, holding the injured dog.
Ruddy was yelping; one leg hung limp and useless.</p>

<p>For a tense moment the doctor confronted Briggs.
He pushed the door shut, with rage and bitterness.</p>

<p>“And you, sir,” he suddenly exclaimed, “you go
against my orders; you leave your bed and expose yourself
to serious consequences, for the sake of a beast&mdash;who
will do a thing like <i>this</i>!”</p>

<p>Furiously he nodded downward at the dog.</p>

<p>The captain advanced and, with a hand that trembled,
caressed the rough muzzle.</p>

<p>“Hal?” asked he, under his breath. “This, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, this! Nearly killed the poor creature, sir!
Kicked him. And that wasn’t enough. When the
dog still tried to follow him, grabbed him up and
dashed him down on the steps. This leg’s broken.
Ribs, too, I think. A miracle the dog wasn’t killed.
Your grandson’s intention was to kill him, all right
enough, but I guess he didn’t want to take time for
it!” Filhiol’s lips were trembling with passion, so
that he could hardly articulate. “This is horrible!
Injury to a man is bad enough, but a man can defend
himself, and will. But injury to a defenseless, trusting
animal&mdash;my God, sir, if I’d been anything but a
cripple, and if I’d had a weapon handy, I’d have had
your grandson’s blood, so help me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain made no answer, but set his teeth into his
bearded lip. He patted the dog’s head. Ruddy licked
his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” demanded Filhiol. “What have you
to say now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Hal’s gone, and words have no value.
Can you repair this damage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if the internal injuries aren’t too bad. But
that’s not the point. Hal, there, goes scot free and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>“Please, no more!” he begged. “I can’t stand it,
doctor. You’ve got to spare me now!”</p>

<p>Filhiol looked at him with understanding.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” said he. “But help me with poor
old Ruddy, here!”</p>

<p>“Ezra can help you. On a pinch, call in Dr. Marsh,
if you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think my professional skill is still adequate to
set a dog’s leg,” Filhiol retorted.</p>

<p>“And you don’t know how grateful I am to you for
doing it,” said the captain. “I’m grateful, too, for
your not insisting on any more talk about Hal. You’re
good as gold! I wish you knew how much I thank
you!”</p>

<p>The doctor growled something inarticulate and
fondled the whimpering animal. Alpheus Briggs
forced himself to speak again.</p>

<p>“Please excuse me now. I’ve got something very
important to do.” His hand slid into the pocket of his
bathrobe, closed on the paper there, and crumpled it.
“Will you give me a little time to myself? I want
an hour or two undisturbed.”</p>

<p>The temptation was strong on the captain to take the
hand of Filhiol and say some words that might perhaps
serve as a good-by, but he restrained himself.
Where poor old Ezra had understood nothing, Filhiol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
would very swiftly comprehend. So Alpheus Briggs,
even in this supreme moment of leave-taking, held his
peace.</p>

<p>The doctor, however, appeared suddenly suspicious.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he asked, “before I promise you the
privacy you ask, I’ve got one question for you. Have
you overheard any of Hal’s reading lately, or have you
seen any of his translations from the Malay?”</p>

<p>By no slightest quiver of a muscle did the old man
betray himself.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. “What do you mean, doctor?
Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“That’s something I can’t tell you,” said Filhiol,
thankful that no hint had reached Briggs concerning
the curse. Swiftly he thought. Yes, it would well
suit his purpose now to get the captain out of the way.
That would give Filhiol time to run through the litter
of papers in Hal’s room, and to destroy the translation
that might have such fatal consequences if it should
come into the captain’s hands.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said he. “Take whatever time
you need to settle matters relative to Hal’s leaving.
By rights I ought to order you back to bed; but I know
you wouldn’t obey me now, anyhow, so what’s the use?
Only, be reasonably sensible, captain. Even though
Hal <i>has</i> made a fearful mess of everything, your life
is worth a very great deal to lots of people!”</p>

<p>The captain nodded. Filhiol’s admonitions suddenly
seemed very trivial, just as the world and life
itself had all at once become. Already these were retreating
from his soul, leaving it alone, with the one
imperative of duty. At the last page of the book of
life, Alpheus Briggs realized with swift insight how
slight the value really was of that poor volume, and
how gladly&mdash;when love and duty bade him&mdash;he
could forever close it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll talk this all over in the morning, doctor,”
said he. “But till then, no more of it. I’ve got to get
my bearings and answer my helm better before I’ll
know exactly what to do. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain, I think I do,” answered the doctor,
with compassion. He said no more, but hobbled towards
the kitchen, there to summon Ezra and do what
could be done for Ruddy.</p>

<p>Thus Captain Briggs was left alone. Alone with
the stern consummation of his duty, as he saw it.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">“ONE MUST DIE”</p>

<p>Briggs entered his cabin, and locked both doors;
then fastened the window giving on the porch. He
went to the fireplace, overhung with all that savage
arsenal, and put a couple of birch-logs on the glowing
coals.</p>

<p>He sat down in his big chair by the fire, pondered a
moment with the fireglow on his deep-wrinkled,
bearded face, then from the pocket of his bathrobe
drew the crumpled bit of paper. Again he studied it,
reading it over two or three times. In a low voice he
slowly pronounced the words, as if to grave them on
his consciousness:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The curse must be fulfilled, to the last breath, for by
Shiva and the Trimurthi, what is written is written. But
if he through whom the curse descendeth on another is
stricken to horror and to death, then the Almighty Vishnu,
merciful, closes that page. And he who through another’s
sin was cursed, is cleansed. Thus may the curse be fulfilled.
But always one of two must die. <i>Tuan Allah poonia
krajah!</i> It is the work of the Almighty One! One of two
must die!”</p>

<p class="p1">For some minutes he pondered all this. Before him
rose visions&mdash;the miasmatic Malay town; the battle
in the Straits; the yellow and ghostlike presence of
the witch-woman, shrilling her curse at him; the death
of Scurlock and the boy, of Mahmud Baba, of Kuala
Pahang, of the <i>amok</i> Malay who, shot through the
spine and half paralyzed, still had writhed forward,
horribly, to kill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“No wonder the curse has followed me,” murmured
the old man. “I haven’t suffered yet as any one would
have to suffer to pay for all that. For all that, and
so much more&mdash;God, how much more! It’s justice,
that’s all; and who can complain about justice? Poor
Hal, poor boy of mine! No justice about <i>his</i> having to
bear it, is there? Why should <i>he</i> suffer for what <i>I</i> did
fifty years ago? Thank God! Oh, thank God!” he
exclaimed with passionate fervor, “that I can pay it
all, and make him free!”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence a little while, his face not
at all marked with grief or pain, but haloed with a
high and steadfast calm. The drumming rain on the
porch roof, the shuddering impact of the wind as the
storm set its shoulders against Snug Haven, saddened
him with thoughts of the fugitive, bearing the curse
that was not his, out there somewhere in the tumult and
the on-drawing night, trying to flee the whips of atavism.
But through that sadness rose happier thoughts.</p>

<p>“It’s only for a little while now,” said the captain.
“The curse is nearly ended. When I’ve paid the
score, it will lift, and he’ll come back again. Poor Hal&mdash;how
little he knew, when he was writing this paper,
that he was giving me the chart to steer my right
course! If the hand of some divine Providence isn’t
in this, then there’s no Providence to rule this world!”</p>

<p>Another thought struck him. Hal knew nothing of
the fact that his grandfather had found the curse. He
must never know. In the life of better things that
soon was to open out for him, no embittering self-accusation
must intrude. All proof must be destroyed.</p>

<p>Captain Briggs tossed the curse of Dengan Jouga
into the flames just beginning to flicker upward from
the curling birch-bark. The paper browned and puffed
into flame. It shriveled to a crisp black shell, on
which, for a moment or two, the writing glowed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
angry lines of crimson. Captain Briggs caught one
last glimpse of a word or two, grotesquely distorted&mdash;”<i>The
curse&mdash;horror and death&mdash;one&mdash;must die&mdash;</i>”</p>

<p>Despite himself he shuddered. The hate and malice
of the old witch-woman seemed visibly glaring out at
him from the flames, after half a century. From the
other side of the world, even from “beyond the Silken
Sea,” words of vengeance blinked at him, then suddenly
vanished; and with a gust of the storm-wind, up
the chimney whirled the feather bit of ash. The captain
drew his bath robe a little closer round him, and
glanced behind him into the dark corners of the cabin.</p>

<p>“This&mdash;is very strange!” he whispered.</p>

<p>Still he sat pondering. Especially he recalled the
Malay he had shot through the spine. That lithe,
strong man, suddenly paralyzed into a thing half dead
and yet alive, was particularly horrible to remember.
Helplessness, death that still did not die....</p>

<p>A spark snapped out upon the floor. He set his
foot on it.</p>

<p>“That’s the only way to deal with evil,” said he.
“Stamp it out! And if we’re the evil ourselves, if
we’re the spark of devil-fire, out we must go! What
misery I could have saved for Hal, if I’d understood
before&mdash;and what a cheap price! An old, used-up
life for a new, strong, fresh one.”</p>

<p>His mind, seeking what way of death would be most
fitting, reverted to the poisoned kris, symbol of the evil
he had done and of the old, terrible days. He peered
up at the mantelpiece; but, look as he would, failed to
discover the kris. He rose to his feet, and explored
the brickwork with his hands in the half-light reflected
from the fire. Nothing there. The hooks, empty,
showed where the Malay blade had been taken down,
but of the blade itself no trace remained.</p>

<p>The old captain shivered, amazed and wondering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
In this event there seemed more than the hand of mere
coincidence. Hal was gone; the kris had vanished.
The captain could not keep cold tentacles of fear from
reaching for his heart. To him it seemed as if he
could almost see the eyeless face looming above him,
could almost hear the implacable mockery of its far,
mirthless laughter.</p>

<p>“God!” he whispered. “This won’t do! I&mdash;I’ll
lose my nerve if I keep on this way, and nerve is what
I’ve got to have now!”</p>

<p>Why had Hal taken that knife? What wild notion
had inspired the boy? Alpheus Briggs could not imagine.
But something predestined, terrible, seemed
closing in. The captain felt the urge of swift measures.
If Hal were to be rescued, it must be at once.</p>

<p>Turning from the fireplace of such evil associations,
he lighted the ship’s lamp that hung above it. He sat
down at the desk, opened a drawer and took out two
photographs. These he studied a few minutes, with
the lamp-light on his white hair, his venerable beard,
his heavy features. Closely he inspected the photographs.</p>

<p>One was a group, showing himself with the family
that once had been, but now had almost ceased to be.
The other was a portrait of Hal. Carefully the old
man observed this picture, taken but a year ago, noting
the fine, broad forehead, the powerful shoulders, the
strength of the face that looked out so frankly at him.
For the first time he perceived a quality in this face he
had never seen before&mdash;the undertone of arrogant
power, born of unbeaten physical strength.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head with infinite sadness.</p>

<p>“That’s the real curse that lay on me,” he murmured.
“That’s what I’ve got to pay for now. Well,
so be it.”</p>

<p>He kissed both pictures tenderly, and put them back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
into the drawer. From it he took a box, and from the
box a revolver&mdash;an old revolver, the very same that
he had carried in the <i>Silver Fleece</i> fifty long years ago.</p>

<p>“You’ve done very great evil,” said Alpheus Briggs
slowly. “Now you’re going to pay for it by doing
at least one good act. That’s justice. God is being
very good to me, showing me the way.”</p>

<p>He broke open the revolver, spun the cylinder and
snapped the hammer two or three times.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” judged he. “This is an important
job. It mustn’t be made a mess of.”</p>

<p>He looked for and found a few cartridges, and carefully
loaded the weapon, then snapped it shut, and laid
it on the desk. The sound of Dr. Filhiol, coming with
another cane along the hall, caused him to slide the gun
into the drawer. Filhiol knocked at the door, and
Briggs arose to open it. He showed no signs of perturbation.
A calm serenity glowed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it time you got your writing finished and
went to bed?” the doctor demanded tartly.</p>

<p>“Almost time. I’m just finishing up. I sha’n’t be
long now. Tell me, how’s Ruddy?”</p>

<p>“We’ve made a fair job of it, and Ezra’s gone to
his room. He’s taking everything terribly to heart.
Anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you. Good night.”</p>

<p>The captain’s hand enfolded Filhiol’s. Neither by
any undue pressure nor by word did he give the doctor
any hint of the fact that this good-by was final. The
old doctor turned and very wearily stumped away up-stairs.
Briggs turned back into his cabin.</p>

<p>“A good, true friend,” said he. “Another one I’m
sorry to leave, just as I’m sorry to leave the girl and
Ezra. But&mdash;well&mdash;”</p>

<p>At his task once more, he fetched from the safe his
black metal cash-box, and set himself to looking over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
few deeds, mortgages and other papers, making sure
that all was in order for the welfare of Hal. He reread
his will, assuring himself that nothing could prevent
Hal from coming into the property, and also that a
bequest to Ezra was in correct form. This done, he
replaced the papers in the safe.</p>

<p>On his desk a little clock was ticking, each motion
of its balance-wheel bringing nearer the tragedy impending.
The captain glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Getting late,” said he. “Only one more thing to
do now, and then I’m ready.”</p>

<p>He set himself to write a letter that should make all
things clear to Hal. But first he brought out the revolver
once more, and laid it on the desk as a kind of
<i>memento mori</i>, lest in the writing his soul should
weaken.</p>

<p>The lamp, shining down upon the old man’s gnarled
fingers as they painfully traced the words of explanation
and farewell, also struck high-lights from the revolver.</p>

<p>The captain’s eyes, now and then leaving the written
pages as he paused to think, rested upon the gun. At
sight of it he smiled; and once he reached out, caressed
it and smiled.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p class="pch">ON THE <i><span class="reduct">KITTIWINK</span></i></p>

<p>When Hal left Snug Haven, he bent his shoulders to
the storm and with his suit-cases plowed through the
gathering dusk toward Hadlock’s Cove.</p>

<p>Cold, slashing rain and boistering gusts left his
wrath uncooled. Ugly, brutalized, he kept his way
past the smithy&mdash;past Laura’s house, and so with
glowering eyes on into the evening that caught and ravened
at him.</p>

<p>The sight of Laura’s house filled him with an access
of rage. That calm security of shaded windows behind
the rain-scourged hedge seemed to typify the girl’s
protection against him. He twisted his mouth into an
ugly grin.</p>

<p>“Think you’re safe, don’t you?” he growled, pausing
a moment to glower at the house. “Think I can’t
get you, eh? I haven’t even begun yet!”</p>

<p>In the turmoil of his mind, no clear plan had as yet
taken form. He knew only that he had a boat and full
supplies, that from him the ocean held no secrets, that
his muscles and his will had never yet known defeat,
and that the girl was his if he could take her.</p>

<p>“She’ll turn me down cold and get away with it,
will she?” he snarled. “She will&mdash;like hell!”</p>

<p>Forward he pushed again, meeting no one, and so
passed Geyser Rock, now booming under the charges
of the surf. He skirted a patch of woods, flailed by
the wind, and beyond this turned through a stone wall,
to follow a path that led down to the cove. On either
side of the path stretched a rolling field, rich with tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
grasses, with daisies, buttercups, milfoil and devil’s
paint-brush, drenched and beaten down in the dusk by
the sweep of the storm.</p>

<p>Louder and more loud rose, fell, the thunders of the
sea, as Hal approached the rocky dune at the far side of
the field&mdash;a dune that on its other edge sank to a
shingle beach that bordered the cove.</p>

<p>To eastward, this beach consolidated itself into the
rocky headland of Barberry Point, around which the
breakers were curving to hurl themselves on the shingle.
The wind, however, was at this point almost parallel
with the shore. Hal reckoned, as he tramped
across the field, that with good judgment and stiff work
he could get the <i>Kittiwink</i> to sea at once.</p>

<p>And after that, what? He did not know. No
definite idea existed in that half-crazed, passion-scourged
brain. The driving power of his strength
accursed, took no heed of anything but flight. Away,
away, only to be away!</p>

<p>“God!” he panted, stumbling up the dune to its top,
where salt spray and stinging rain skirled upon him in
skittering drives. He dropped his burdens, and flung
out both huge arms toward the dark, tumbling void of
waters, streaked with crawling lines of white. “God!
that’s what I want! That’s what they’re trying to keep
me away from! I’m going to have it now&mdash;by God,
I am!”</p>

<p>He stood there a moment, his oilskin hat slapping
about his face. At his right, three hundred yards away
or so, he could just glimpse the dark outlines of Jim
Gordon’s little store that supplied rough needs of lobstermen
and fishers. Hal’s lip curled with scorn of
the men he knew were gathered in that dingy, smoky
place, swapping yarns and smoking pipes. They preferred
that to the freedom of the night, the storm, the
sea! At them he shook his fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s not one of you that’s half the man I am!”
he shouted. “You sit in there and run me down. I
know! You’re doing it now&mdash;telling how gramp had
to pay because I licked a bully, and how I’ve got to
apologize! But you don’t dare come out into a night
like this. I can outsail you and outfight you all&mdash;and
to hell with you!”</p>

<p>His rage somehow a little eased, he turned to the task
immediately confronting him. The beach sloped
sharply to the surf. A litter of driftwood, kelp and
mulched rubbish was swirling back and forth among
the churning pebbles that with each refluent wave went
clattering down in a mad chorus. Here, there, drawn
up out of harm’s way, lay lobster-pots and dories.
Just visible as a white blur tossing on the obscure
waters, the <i>Kittiwink</i> rode at her buoy.</p>

<p>“Great little boat!” cried Hal. A vast longing
swept over him to be aboard, and away. The sea was
calling his youth, strength, daring.</p>

<p>Laura? And would he go without the girl? Yes.
Sometime, soon perhaps, he would come back, would
seize her, carry her away; but for now that plan had
grown as vaguely formless as his destination. Fumes
of liquor in his brain, of passion in his heart, blent with
the roaring confusion of the tempest. All was confusion,
all a kind of wild and orgiastic dream, culmination
of heredity, of a spirit run <i>amok</i>.</p>

<p>Night, storm and wind shouted to the savage in this
man. And, standing erect there in the dark, arms up
to fleeing cloud and ravening gale, he howled back with
mad laughter:</p>

<p>“Coming now! By God, I’m coming now!”</p>

<p>There was foam on his lips as he strode down the
beach, flung the suit-cases into a dory&mdash;and with a
run and a huge-shouldered shove across the shingle
fairly flung the boat into the surf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Waist-deep in chilling smothers of brine, he floundered,
dragged himself into the dory that shipped
heavy seas, and flung the oars on to the thole-pins.
He steadied her nose into the surf, and with a few
strong pulls got her through the tumble. A matter of
two or three minutes, with such strength as lay in his
arms of steel, brought him to the lee of the <i>Kittiwink’s</i>
stern. He hove the suit-cases to the deck of the dancing
craft, then scrambled aboard and made the painter
fast.</p>

<p>Again he laughed, exultingly. Now for the first
time in his life his will could be made law. Now he
stood on his own deck, with plenty of supplies below,
and&mdash;above, about him&mdash;the unlimited power of the
gale to drive him any whither he should choose.</p>

<p>He strode to the companionway, his feet sure on the
swaying deck, his body lithely meeting every plunge,
and slid back the hatch-cover. Down into the cabin
he pitched the cases and followed them. He struck a
match. It died. He cursed bitterly, tried again, and
lighted the cabin-lamp. His eyes, with the affection
of ownership, roved around the little place, taking in
the berths, the folding-table, the stools. He threw the
suit-cases into a berth, opened one and took out a
square-face, which he uncorked and tipped high.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he sighed. “Some class!” He set the
bottle in the rack and breathed deeply. “Nice little
berths, eh? Laura&mdash;she’d look fine here. She’d fit
great, as crew. And if she gave me any of her lip,
then&mdash;”</p>

<p>His fist, doubled, swayed under the lamp-shine as he
surveyed it proudly.</p>

<p>“Great little boat,” judged Hal. “She’ll outsail
’em all, and I’m the boy to make her walk!”</p>

<p>Huge, heavy, evil-faced, he stood there, swaying as
the <i>Kittiwink</i> rode the swells. He cast open his reefer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
took out pipe and tobacco, and lighted up. As he
sucked at the stem, his hard lips, corded throat and
great jaws gave an impression of brutal power, in no
wise differing from that of old Alpheus Briggs, half a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>“Make me go to school and wear a blue ribbon,”
he gibed, his voice a contrabass to the shrilling of the
wind aloft in the rig, the groaning and creaking of the
timbers. “Make me go round apologizing to drunken
bums. Like&mdash;hell!”</p>

<p>A gleam of metal from the opened suit-case attracted
his eyes. He took up the kris, and with vast approval
studied it. The feel of the lotus-bud handle seemed
grateful to his palm. Its balance joyed him. The
keen, wavy blade, maculated with the rust of blood and
brine, and with the groove where lay another stain
whose meaning he knew not, held for him a singular
fascination. Back, forth he slashed the weapon, whistling
it through the air, flashing it under the lamp-light.</p>

<p>“Fine!” he approved, with thickened speech.
“Glad I got it&mdash;might come handy in a pinch, what?”</p>

<p>He stopped swinging the kris, and once more observed
it, more closely still. Tentatively he ran his
thumb along the edge, testing it, then scratched with
some inchoate curiosity at the poison crystallized in the
groove.</p>

<p>“Wonder what that stuff is, anyhow?” said he.
“Doesn’t look like the rest. Maybe it’s the blood of
some P. I., like McLaughlin. <i>That</i> ought to make a
dirty-looking stain, same as this. Maybe it will, some
of these days, if he crosses my bows. Maybe it will
at that!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<p class="pch">FATE STRIKES</p>

<p>Hal tossed the kris into the berth, and was just about
to reach for the bottle again when a <i>thump-thump-thumping</i>
along the hull startled his attention.</p>

<p>“What the devil’s that, now?” he growled, stiffening.
The sound of voices, then a scramble of feet on
deck, flung him toward the companion-ladder.
“<i>Who’s there?</i>”</p>

<p>“He’s here, boys, all right!” exulted a voice above.
“We got him this time, the&mdash;”</p>

<p>Have you seen a bulldog bristle to the attack with
bared teeth and throaty growl? So, now, Hal Briggs.</p>

<p>“Got me, have you?” he flung up at the invaders.
“More o’ that rotten gurry-bucket’s crew, eh? More
o’ Bucko McLaughlin’s plug-uglies!”</p>

<p>“Easy there,” sounded a caution, as if holding some
one back from advancing on Hal. “He’s mebbe got
a gun.”</p>

<p>“T’ hell wid it!” shouted another. “He ain’t
gonna lambaste half our crew an’ the ole man, an’ git
away wid it! Come on, if there’s one o’ ye wid the
guts of a man. We’ll rush the son of a pup!”</p>

<p>Heavy sea-boots appeared on the ladder. Hal
leaped, grabbed, flung his muscles into a backward haul&mdash;and
before the first attacker realized what had happened,
he landed on his back. One pile-driver fist
to the jaw, and the invader quivered into oblivion,
blood welling from a lip split to the teeth.</p>

<p>“There’s one o’ you!” shouted Hal. “One more!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>”
He laughed uproariously, half drunk with alcohol,
wholly drunk with the strong waters of battle.
“Looks like I’d have to make a job of it, and clean the
bunch! Who’s next?”</p>

<p>Only silence answered a moment. This swift attack
and sudden loss seemed to have disconcerted Mac’s
men. Hal kicked the fallen enemy into a corner, and
faced the companionway. His strategic position, he
realized, was almost impregnable. Only a madman
would have ventured up to that narrow and slippery
deck in the night, with an undetermined number of men
armed, perhaps, with murderous weapons, awaiting
him. Hal was no madman. A steady fighter, he,
and of good generalship. In his heart he meant, as
he stood there, to kill or cripple every one of those now
arrayed against him. He dared take no chances.
Tense as a taut spring, he crouched and waited.</p>

<p>Then as he heard whisperings, furious gusts of mumbled
words, oaths at the very top of the companion, an
idea took him. He snatched up the unconscious man,
thrust him up the ladder and struggled behind him with
titanic force. His legs, massive pillars, braced themselves
against the sides of the companion. Like a battle-ax
he swung the vanquished enemy, beating about
him with this human flail. With fortune, might he not
sweep one or two assailants off into the running seas?</p>

<p>He saw vague forms, felt the impact of blows, as
his weapon struck. Came a rush. Overborne, he fell
backward to the floor. Up he leaped, as feet clattered
down the ladder, and snatched the kris.</p>

<p>But he could not drive it home in the bulky, dark
form leaping down at him. For, lightning-swift, sinewed
arms of another man behind him whipped round
his neck, jerked his head back, bore him downward.</p>

<p>He realized that he was lost. He had forgotten the
forward hatch, opening down into the galley; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
forgotten the little passageway behind him. Now one
of McLaughlin’s men, familiar with the build of the
<i>Kittiwink</i>, had got a strangling grip on him. A wild
yell of triumph racketed through the cabin, as three
more men dropped into that little space.</p>

<p>Hal knew he must use strategy. Backward he fell:
and as he fell, he twisted. His right hand still held
the kris; his left got a grip on the other’s throat.</p>

<p>That other man immediately grew dumb, and ceased
to breathe, as the terrible fingers closed. Volleys of
blows and kicks rained on Hal ineffectively. Still the
fingers tightened; the man’s face grew horribly dusky,
slaty-blue under the lamp-light, while his tongue protruded
and his staring eyes injected themselves with
blood.</p>

<p>The arm round Hal’s neck loosened, fell limp. Hal
flung the man from him, groveled up under the cross-cutting
slash of blows, and bored in.</p>

<p>The crash of a stool on his right wrist numbed his
arm to the elbow; the stool, shattered, fell apart, and
one leg made smithereens of the lamp-globe. The
smoky flare redly lighted a horrible, fantastic war.
Hal fought to snatch up the knife again; the others to
keep him from it, to trample him, bash him in, smear
his brains and blood on the floor. Scientific fighting
went to pot. This was just jungle war, the war of
gouge and bite, confused, unreal.</p>

<p>All the boy knew was that he swayed, bent and recovered
in the midst of terrible blows, and that one arm
would not serve him. The other fist landed here,
there; and now it had grown red, though whether from
its own blood or from the wounds of foemen, who
could tell? Strange fires spangled outward before
Hal’s eyes; he tasted blood, and, clacking his jaws,
set his teeth into a hand and through it.</p>

<p>Something wrenched, cracked dully. Blasphemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
howled through the smoky air, voicing the anguish of
a broken arm. A rolling, swaying, tumbling mass, the
men trampled the fallen one, pulping his face. Broken
glass gritted under hammering bootheels, as the shards
of lamp-chimney were ground fine.</p>

<p>Back, forth, strained the fighters, with each heave
and wallow of the boat. The floor grew slippery.
The folding-table, torn from its hinges, collapsed into
kindling; and one of these sticks, aimed at Hal’s head,
missed him, but struck the square-face.</p>

<p>Liquor gurgled down; the smell of whisky added its
fetor to the stench of oil, bilge, sweat and blood. The
floor grew slippery, and crimson splashes blotched the
cabin walls.</p>

<p>“Kill&mdash;the son&mdash;of&mdash;” strainingly grunted some
one.</p>

<p>Hal choked out a gasping, husky laugh. Only one
eye was doing duty now; but that one still knew the
kris was lying in the corner by the starboard berth.</p>

<p>He tugged, bucked, burst through, fell on the kris,
grappled its knob and writhed up, crouching.</p>

<p>He flung the blade aloft to strike. Everything was
whirling in a haze of dust and dancing confusion, lurid
under the flare. Grinning, bleeding faces, rage-distorted,
gyrated before him. He swirled the kris at the
nearest.</p>

<p>A hand, vising his wrist, snapped the blade downward,
drove it back. Hal felt a swift sting, a burning,
lancinating pain in his right pectoral muscle. It
seemed to pierce the chest, the lung itself.</p>

<p>He dropped his arm, staring. The kris, smeared
brightly red, thumped to the floor.</p>

<p>“Got ’im, b’ God!” wheezed somebody.</p>

<p>“Got him&mdash;yes, an’ now it won’t be healthy fer us,
if we’re caught here, neither!” panted another.</p>

<p>The men stood away from him, peering curiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Hal confronted them, one arm limp. The other hand
rested against the cabin bulkhead. He swayed, with
the swaying of the boat; his head, sagging forward,
seemed all at once very heavy. He felt a hot trickle
down his breast.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you’ve got me, you&mdash;” he coughed, and,
leaning his back against the bulkhead, got his free hand
feebly to the wound. It came away horribly red. By
the smoky, feeble flare, he blinked at it. The three
hulking men still on foot&mdash;vague figures, with black
shadows on bearded faces, with eyes of fear and dying
anger&mdash;found no answer. One sopped at a cut cheek
with his sleeve; another rubbed his elbow and growled
a curse. On the cabin floor two lay inert, amid the
trample of débris.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> you’ve done it, Coombs,” suddenly spat the
smallest of McLaughlin’s men. He shook a violent
forefinger at the blood-smeared kris that had fallen
near the ladder. “Now we got murder on our hands,
you damn fool! We didn’t come here to kill the son of
a dog. We only come to give him a damn good beatin’-up,
an’ now see what you’ve went an’ done! We
got to clear out, all of us! An’ stick, too; we got to fix
this story right!”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what d’you mean?” stammered Coombs,
he of the bleeding cheek. He had gone ashy pale.
The whiteness of his skin make startling contrast with
the oozing blood. “What story? What we gotta
do?”</p>

<p>“Get ashore an’ all chew it over an’ agree on how
we wasn’t within a mile o’ here to-night. Fix it, an’
git ready to swear to it! If we don’t, we’ll all go up!
Come along out o’ here! Quick!”</p>

<p>“Aw, hell! If he dies, serves him right!” spoke up
the third man. “They can’t touch us fer killin’ a
skunk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll soon find out if they can or not!” retorted
the small man, livid with fear. “Out o’ here now!”</p>

<p>“An’ not fix him up none? Not bandage him ner
nothing?” put in Coombs. “Gosh!”</p>

<p>“Bandage nothin’!” cried the small man. “Tully’s
right. We got to be clearin’. But <i>I</i> say, set fire to
her an’ burn her where she lays, an’ him in her, an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ have the whole damn town here, an’ everythin’!
You got a head on you like a capstan. Come
on, beat it!”</p>

<p>“We can’t go an’ leave our fellers here, can we?”
demanded Coombs, while Hal, sliding down along the
bulkhead, collapsed upon the blood-stained floor. He
felt his life oozing out hotly, but now had no power
even to raise a hand. Coombs peered down, his eyes
unnaturally big. “We can’t leave <i>them</i>! That’d be
a dead give-away. An’ we hadn’t oughta leave a man
bleed to death that way, neither.”</p>

<p>“T’ hell with ’im!” shrilled the little man, more and
more panic-stricken. “We should worry! Git hold
o’ Nears an’ Dunning here, an’ on deck with ’em. We
can git ’em ashore, an’ the others, too, in the dory.
We can all git down to Hammill’s fish-shed an’ no one
the wiser. Give us a hand here, you!”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to stay an’ fix this here man up,” decided
Coombs. “I reckon I stuck him, or he stuck
himself because I gaffled onta his hand. Anyhow, I
done it. You clear out, if you wanta. I ain’t goin’
to let that feller&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re comin’ with us, an’ no double-crossin’!”
shouted Tully, his bruised face terrible, one eye blackened
and swollen. He bored a big-knuckled fist
against Coombs’s nose. “If you’re caught here, we’re
<i>all</i> done. You’re comin’ now, or, by the jumpin’ jews-harps,
I’ll knock you cold myself, an’ lug you straight
ashore!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ I’ll help ye!” volunteered the little man, with
a string of oaths. “Come on now, git busy!”</p>

<p>Overborne, Coombs had to yield. The three men
prepared to make good their escape and to cover all
tracks. Not even lifting Hal into a berth, but leaving
him sprawled face-downward on the floor, with blood
more and more soaking his heavy reefer, they dragged
the unconscious men to the companion, hauled them up
and across the pitching, slippery deck, and dropped
them like potato sacks into the dory that had brought
them. Then they did likewise with the unconscious
man Hal had used as a flail against them. In the dark
and storm, all this took minutes and caused great exertion.
But at last it was done; and now Tully once
more descended to the cabin.</p>

<p>He looked around with great care, blinking his one
still serviceable eye, his torn face horrible by the guttering
oil-flame that danced as puffs of wind entered the
hatch.</p>

<p>“What you doin’ down there, Tully?” demanded a
voice from above. “Friskin’ him fer his watch?”</p>

<p>“I’ll frisk <i>you</i> when I git you ashore!” Tully flung
up at him. Coombs slid down into the cabin.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said he, “but I ain’t trustin’ you
much!”</p>

<p>“Aw, go to hell!” Tully spat. He stooped and began
pawing over the ruck on the floor. Here he picked
up a cap, there a piece of torn sleeve. He even found
a button, and pocketed that. His search was thorough.
When it ended, nothing incriminating was left.</p>

<p>“I reckon they won’t git much on us <i>now</i>,” he
grinned, and contemplatively worked back and forth a
loosened tooth that hardly hung to the gum. “An’
if they try to lay it on us, they can’t prove nothin’.
All of us swearin’ together can git by. There ain’t no
witness except <i>him</i>,” with a jerk of the thumb at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
gasping, unconscious form. “Nobody, unless he gits
well, which he ain’t noways likely to.”</p>

<p>He rolled Hal over, looked down with malice and
hate at the pale, battered face, listened a moment to the
laboring, slow <i>râle</i> of the breath, and nodded with satisfaction.
Even the bloody froth on Hal’s blue lips
gave him joy.</p>

<p>“You got what’s comin’ to <i>you</i>, all right!” he
sneered. “Got it proper. Thought you’d git funny
with Mac an’ his gang, huh? Always butted through
everythin’, did you? Well, this here was one proposition
you couldn’t butt through. We was one too many
fer <i>you</i>, all righto!”</p>

<p>He turned, and saw Coombs with the kris in hand.
Fear leaped into his face, but Coombs only gibed:</p>

<p>“You’re a great one, ain’t you? Coverin’ up the
story o’ what happened here an’ leavin’ that in a corner!”</p>

<p>Fear gave way to sudden covetousness.</p>

<p>“Gimme that there knife!” demanded Tully.
“There <i>is</i> a souvenir! That there’s a krish. I can
hide it O. K. Gimme it!”</p>

<p>Coombs’s answer was to stoop, lay the kris down and
set his huge sea-boot on it. A quick, upward wrench
at the lotus-bud handle and the snaky, poisoned blade,
maybe a thousand years old, snapped with a jangle of
dissevered steel.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” shouted Tully. But already Coombs
had swung to the companion. One toss, and lotus-bud
and shattered blade gyrated into the dark. The waves,
white-foaming, received them; they vanished forever
from the world of men.</p>

<p>“On deck with you now!” commanded Coombs.
“If we’re goin’ to do this at all, we’re goin’ to make a
good job of it. You go first!”</p>

<p>Tully had to obey. Coombs puffed out the light and&mdash;leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Hal Briggs in utter dark, bleeding, poisoned,
dying&mdash;followed on up the ladder. The dory pushed
away, laden with three unconscious men and three
others by no means unscathed of battle. Toward the
shore it struggled, borne on the hungry surges.</p>

<p>Thus fled the men of McLaughlin’s crew&mdash;avenged.
Thus, brought low by the cursèd thing that had come
half-way ’round the world and waited half a hundred
years to strike, Hal sank toward the great blackness.</p>

<p>Lotus-bud, symbol of sleep, and poisoned blade&mdash;cobra-fang
from the dim, mysterious Orient&mdash;now
with their work well done, lay under waves of storm in
a wild, northern sea.</p>

<p>Above, in the black, storm-whipped sky, was the
blind face of Destiny peering with laughter down upon
the fulfilment of its prophecy?</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<p class="pch">IN EXTREMIS</p>

<p>It would be difficult to tell how long the wounded boy
lay there, but after a certain time, some vague glimmering
of consciousness returned. No light came back.
Neither was motion possible to him. His understanding
now was merely pain, confusion and a great roaring
wind and wave. Utter weakness gripped his body;
but more than this seemed to enchain him. By no
effort of his reviving will could he move hand or foot;
and even the slow breath he took, each respiration a
stab of agony, seemed for some reason a mighty effort.</p>

<p>Though Hal knew it not, already the <i>curaré</i> was at
work, the <i>curaré</i> whose terrible effect is this: that it
paralyzes every muscle, first the voluntaries, then those
of the respiratory centers and of the heart itself. Yet
he could think and feel. <i>Curaré</i> does not numb sensation
or attack the brain. It strikes its victims down
by rendering them more helpless than an infant; and
then, fingering its way to the breath and to the blood,
closes on those a grip that has one outcome only.</p>

<p>Hal Briggs, who had so gloried in the strength and
swift control of all his muscles, who had so wrought
evil and violent things, trusting to his unbeatable
power, now lay there, chained, immobile, paralyzed.</p>

<p>He thought, after a few vain efforts to move:</p>

<p>“I must be badly cut to be as weak as this. I must
be bled almost to death. I’m going to die. That’s
certain!”</p>

<p>Still, he was not afraid. The soul of him confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
death, unterrified. Even while his laboring heart
struggled against the slow instillation of the <i>curaré</i>,
and even while his lungs caught sluggishly at the air,
his mind was undaunted.</p>

<p>He wanted light, but there was none. A velvet dark
enveloped everything&mdash;a dark in which the creaking
fabric of the <i>Kittiwink</i> heaved, plunged till it rolled
his inert body back against the shell of the craft, then
forward again.</p>

<p>“I got some of them, anyhow,” he reflected, with
strange calmness. “They didn’t get away without a
lot of punishment. If they hadn’t knifed me, I’d have
cleaned up the whole bunch!”</p>

<p>A certain satisfaction filled his thoughts. If one
must die, it is good to know the enemy has taken grievous
harm.</p>

<p>Still, what, after all, did it matter? He felt so
very languid, so transfixed with that insistent pain in
the right lung! Even though he had killed them all,
would that have recompensed him for the failure of all
his cherished plans, for the loss of the life that was to
have meant so wildly much to him?</p>

<p>He felt a warm oozing on his breast, and knew blood
was still seeping. His lips tasted salty, but he could
not even spit away the blood on them. <i>Curaré</i> is of a
hundred different types. This, which he had received,
had numbed his muscles beyond any possibility of waking
them to action. A few vain efforts convinced him
he could not move. So there he lay, suffering, wondering
how any loss of blood&mdash;so long as life remained&mdash;could
so paralyze him.</p>

<p>His thoughts drifted to Snug Haven, to his grandfather,
to Ezra, to Laura, but now in more confusion.
He realized that he was fainting and could do nothing
to prevent it. A humming, different from the storm-wind,
welled up in his ears. He felt that he was sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
down, away. Then all at once he ceased alike to
think, to feel.</p>

<p>When next he came to some vague consciousness, he
sensed&mdash;millions of miles away&mdash;a touch on his
shoulder, a voice in his ears. He knew that voice; and
yet, somehow, he could not tell whose voice it was.
He understood that his head was being raised. Very
dimly, through closed eyelids that he could not open,
he perceived the faint glimmer of a light.</p>

<p>“Hal!” he heard his name. And then again:
“Hal!”</p>

<p>The futile effort to move, to answer, spent his last
forces. Once more the blackness of oblivion received
him mercifully.</p>

<p>“Hal! Oh, God! Hal, speak to me! <i>Answer
me!</i>” Laura’s voice trembled, broke as she pleaded.
“Oh&mdash;they’ve killed you! <i>They’ve killed you!</i>”</p>

<p>With eyes of terror she peered down at him. In her
shaking hand the little electric search-lamp sent its
trembling beam to illuminate the terrible sight there
on the cabin floor. The girl could get only broken impressions&mdash;a
pale, wan face; closed eyes that would
not open; a fearful welter of blood on throat and
chest.</p>

<p>“Look at me! Speak to me! You aren’t dead&mdash;look
at me! It’s Laura! Hal&mdash;<i>Hal</i>!”</p>

<p>Her words were disjointed. For a moment presence
of mind left her. For a moment, she was just a
frightened girl, suddenly confronted by this horrible
thing, by the broken, dying body of the man she had
so loved. And while that moment lasted she cried out;
she gathered Hal to her breast; she called to him and
called again, and got no answer.</p>

<p>But soon her first anguish passed. She whipped
back her reason and forced herself to think. The prescience
she had felt of evil had indeed come true. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
furtive, dark figures that from her window she had
seen slinking toward Hadlock’s Cove, had indeed
sought Hal just as she had felt that they were seeking
him. And the numb grief that, after she had seen Hal
passing down the road, had still chained her at that
upper window peering out into the darkening storm,
had all at once given place to action.</p>

<p>What strategies she had had to employ to escape
from the house! What a battle with the tempest she
had fought, with wind and rain tearing at her long coat,
the pocket of which had held the flashlight! Ay, and
that battle had been only a skirmish compared to the
launching of a dory, the mad struggle through the
surf. All thought of danger flung to the wings of
heaven, all fear of Hal abandoned, and of losing her
good name in case of being seen by any one, so she had
battled her way to him&mdash;to warn him, to save him.</p>

<p>Laura, suddenly grown calm with that heroic resolution
which inspires every true woman in the moment of
need, let the boy’s head fall back and mustered her
thoughts. She realized the essential thing was go for
help, at once. Strong as she was, and nerved with
desperation, she knew the task of dragging Hal up the
companionway, of getting him into her dory, of carrying
him ashore in the gale-beaten surf surpassed her
powers.</p>

<p>So she must leave him, even though he should die
alone there.</p>

<p>But, first, she could at least give him some aid. She
peered about her, flicking the electric beam over the
trampled confusion. What could she use for bandages?
A smashed suit-case yawned wide, its contents
slewed about. She caught up a shirt, tore it into broad
strips and, laying the flashlight in the berth, bent to
her work.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” she whispered, as she laid bare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
wound; but though she felt giddy, she kept on. The
sagging dead weight of Hal’s body almost overbore her
strength. She held it up, however, and very tightly
bound him, up around the massive neck, over the back,
across the high-arched, muscular chest. She knotted
her bandages, and let Hal sink down again.</p>

<p>Then she smoothed back his drabbled hair. She
bent and kissed him; snatched the light, turned and fled
up the companion, clambered down into the dory, and
cast loose.</p>

<p>All the strength of her young arms had to strain
their uttermost. Passionately she labored. The
wounded man no longer was the brute who had so
cruelly sought to wrong her. He was no longer the
untamed savage, the bully, the thief. No, in his helplessness
he had gone swiftly back to the boy she had
known and loved&mdash;just Hal, her boy.</p>

<p>The storm-devils, snatching at her, seemed incarnate
things that fought her for his life. The wind
that drove her away from the shingle-beach and toward
the rocks below Jim Gordon’s store, the lathering crests
that spewed their cold surges into the dory as it heaved
high and swung far down, seemed shouting: “Death
to Hal!”</p>

<p>Laura, her hair down and flying wild, pulled till
wrists and arms seemed breaking. For a few minutes
she thought herself lost; but presently, when breath and
strength were at the ragged edge, she began to hear the
loud, rattling clamor of pebbles on the shingle. A
breaker caught the dory, flung it half round, upset it.
Into the water, strangling, struggling, Laura plunged.
The backwash caught her, tugged at her. She found
footing, lost it, fell and choked a cry in cold brine.</p>

<p>The next breaker heaved her up. She crawled
through wrack and weed, over jagged stones, and fell
exhausted on a sodden windrow of drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>For a minute she could move no further, but had to
lie under the pelting rain, with the dark hands of ocean
clutching to drag her back. But presently a little
strength revived. She crawled forward once more,
staggered to her feet, and, falling, getting up again,
won to the top of the dune.</p>

<p>Off to her left, dim through the shouting night, the
vague light-blurs of old man Gordon’s windows were
fronting the tempest. The girl struggled forward,
sobbing for breath. Not all the fury of the North Atlantic,
flung against that shore, had turned her from her
task.</p>

<p>Astonished beyond words, the lobstermen and fishers
eyed her with blank faces as she burst in the door.
Under the light of tin reflectors, quids remained unchewed,
pipes unsmoked. Bearded jaws fell. Eyes
blinked.</p>

<p>The girl’s wet, draggled hair, her bloodless face and
burning eyes stunned them all.</p>

<p>“Quick, quick!” she implored. “Hal Briggs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s he done now, girl?” cried old Sy Whittaker,
starting up. “He ain’t hurt <i>you</i>, has he? If
he <i>has</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s been stabbed, aboard the <i>Kittiwink</i>! He’s
bleeding to death there!”</p>

<p>Chairs scraped. Excitement blazed.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Laura?” cried Gordon. “Stabbed?
Who done it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no matter&mdash;go, quick&mdash;go, <i>go</i>!”</p>

<p>“Damn funny!” growled a voice from behind the
stove. “Gal goin’ aboard night like this, an’ him
stabbed. Looks mighty bad!”</p>

<p>“You’ll look a damn sight wuss if you say that
agin, or anythin’ like it!” shouted the old storekeeper
with doubled fist. “Hal Briggs ain’t worryin’ me
none, but this here is Laura, old man Maynard’s gal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
an’ by the Jeeruzlem nobody ain’t goin’ to say nothin’
about her! Tell me, gal,” he added, “is he hurt bad?”</p>

<p>She caught him by the arm. He had to hold her up.</p>

<p>“Dying, Jim! Bleeding to death! Oh, for the love
of God&mdash;hurry, <i>hurry</i>!”</p>

<p>Around them the rough, bearded men jostled in
pea-coats, slickers, sou’westers. The tin reflectors
struck harsh lights and shadows from rugged faces of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Who could o’ done it?” began Shorrocks, the
blacksmith. “They’d oughta be ketched, an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about that!” cried Gordon. He
caught from a nail a formless old felt hat and jammed
it on his head; he snatched up a lighted lantern standing
on the counter, and with a hobnailed clatter ran for
the door.</p>

<p>“Everybody out!” he bellowed. “Everybody out
now, to help Laura!”</p>

<p>Into the storm he flung himself. All hands cascaded
toward the door.</p>

<p>“You stay here, gal!” advised Asahel Calkins, lobsterman.
“Ain’t no night fer you!”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay! Let me go, too!” she pleaded.
They made way for her. With the men she ran.
Two or three others had lanterns, but these made no
more than tiny dancing blurs of light in the drenching
dark. Along a path, then into the field and up to the
storm-scourged dune they stumbled, pantingly, bucking
the gale. The lanterns set giant legs of shadows striding
up against the curtain of the rain-drive, as the men
pressed onward. Snapping, Laura’s skirts flailed.</p>

<p>Over the dune they charged, and scuffled down to the
dories. Disjointed words, cries, commands whipped
away. Strong hands hustled a dory down. Laura
was clambering in already, but Jim Gordon pulled her
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, gal, no!” he ordered sternly. His voice
flared on the wind as he shoved her into the arms of
Shorrocks. “You, Henry, look out for her. Don’t
let her do nothin’ foolish!”</p>

<p>He set his lantern in the dory, impressed Calkins and
another into his service, and scrambled aboard. A
dozen hands ran the dory out through the first breakers.
Oars caught; and as the men came up the beach, dripping
in the vague lantern-light, the dory pulled away.</p>

<p>To Laura, waiting with distracted fear among the
fishermen, it seemed an hour; yet at the most hardly
fifteen minutes had passed before the little boat came
leaping shoreward in white smothers. Out jumped
Gordon. Laura ran to him, knee-deep in a breaker.</p>

<p>“Is he&mdash;<i>dead</i>?” she shivered, with clacking teeth.</p>

<p>“Nope. Ain’t much time to lose, though, an’ that’s
a fact. He’s cut <i>some</i>, looks like! Goddy mighty,
but there must o’ been some fight out there!”</p>

<p>He turned to the dory. With others, he lifted out
a heavy body, wrapped in sailcloth, horribly suggestive
of a burial at sea. Laura gripped her hands together
for self-mastery.</p>

<p>“Oh, hurry, hurry!” she entreated.</p>

<p>“We’ll do all we kin, gal,” some one answered, “but
we ain’t no real amb’lance-corpse. It’s goin’ to be a
slow job, gittin’ him home.”</p>

<p>“Here, Laura, you carry a lantern an’ go ahead,
’cross the field,” commanded Gordon, with deep wisdom.
Only to give her something to do, something to
occupy her mind, was kindness of the deepest. Into
her hand old Calkins thrust a lantern.</p>

<p>“All ready!” cried he. “H’ist anchor, an’ away!”</p>

<p>Seven or eight men got hold, round the edges of the
sailcloth, and so, swinging the inert Hal as in a cradle,
they stumbled to the road, with Laura going on ahead.</p>

<p>To the right they turned, toward Snug Haven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Now Laura walked beside them. Once in a while she
looked at the white face half seen in its white cradle,
now beginning to be mottled with crimson stains.</p>

<p>But she said no other word. Strong with the calm
that had reasserted itself, she walked that night road of
storm and agony.</p>

<p>Thus was Hal Briggs borne back to his grandfather’s
house.</p>

<p class="p2">In the cabin at Snug Haven old Captain Briggs&mdash;having
finished his letter to Hal and put that, too, in the
safe&mdash;had now come to the last task of all, the sacrifice
that, so he faithfully believed, was to remove the
curse of Dengan Jouga from his boy.</p>

<p>A strange lassitude weighed down upon the old man,
the weariness that comes when a long journey is almost
done and the lights of home begin to shine out through
“the evening dews and damps.” The captain felt that
he had come at last to journey’s end. He sat there at
his desk, eying the revolver, a sturdy, resolute figure;
an heroic figure, unflinchingly determined; a figure ennobled
by impending sacrifice, thoughtful, quiet, strong.
His face, that had been lined with grief, had grown
quite calm. The light upon it seemed less from his
old-time cabin-lamp than from some inner flame.
With a new kind of happiness, more blessed than any
he had ever known, he smiled.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he murmured, with devout earnestness.
“It won’t be long now afore I’m with the others
that have waited for me all this time up there on Croft
Hill. I’m glad to go. It isn’t everybody than can
save the person they love best of anything in the world,
by dying. I thought God was hard with me, but after
all I find He’s very good. He’ll understand. He’d
ought to know, Himself, what dying means to save
something that must be saved!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more he looked at Hal’s picture. Earnestly
and simply, he kissed it. Then he laid it on the desk
again.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said he. “Maybe you won’t ever understand.
Maybe you’ll blame me. Lots will. I’ll be
called a coward. You’ll have to bear some burden on
account of me, but this is the only way.”</p>

<p>His expression reflected the calm happiness which
comes with realization that to die for one beloved is a
better and more blessèd thing than life. Never had
old Captain Briggs felt such joy. Not only was he
opening the ways of life to Hal, but he was cleansing
his own soul. And all at once he felt the horror of
this brooding curse was lifting&mdash;this curse which,
during fifty years, had been reaching out from the
dark and violent past.</p>

<p>He breathed deeply and picked up the revolver.</p>

<p>“God, Thou art very good to me,” he said quietly.
“I couldn’t understand the way till it was shown me.
But now I understand.”</p>

<p>Toward his berth he turned, to lie down there for
the last time. As he advanced toward it he became
vaguely conscious of some confusion outside. A
sound of voices, gusty and faint through the wind,
reached him. These came nearer, grew louder.</p>

<p>Listening, he paused, with a frown. Of a sudden,
feet clumped on the front steps. Heavily they thudded
across the porch. And with sharp insistence his electric
door-bell trilled its musical <i>brrr</i>!</p>

<p>“What’s that, now?” said the captain. Premonitions
of evil pierced his heart. As he hesitated, not
knowing what to do, the front door boomed with the
thudding of stout fists. A heavy boot kicked the
panels. A voice bawled hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Briggs! Ahoy, there, cap’n! Let us in! Fer
God’s sake, let us in!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<p class="pch">CURARÉ</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” cried Alpheus Briggs, astonished
and afraid. He faced toward the front hall.
“What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>A tapping at his window-pane, with eager knuckles,
drew his attention. He heard a woman’s voice&mdash;the
voice of Laura Maynard:</p>

<p>“Here’s Hal! Let us in; quick, <i>quick</i>!”</p>

<p>“Hal?” cried the old man, turning very white.
That evil had indeed come to him was certain now.
He strode to his desk, dropped the revolver into the
top drawer and closed it, then crossed over to the window
and raised the shade. The face of Laura, with
disheveled hair and fear-widened eyes, was peering in
at him. Briggs flung the window up.</p>

<p>“Where is he, Laura? What’s happened? Who’s
here with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t tell you, captain!” she whispered. He
saw her trembling; he noted those big, terror-stricken
eyes, and thrilled with panic. From the front door
sounded a confused bass murmur; and again the bell
sounded. “Men from the store,” she gulped, “Jim
Gordon and others. They’re&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They’re what, Laura? Bringing Hal back
home?”</p>

<p>She nodded silently. He thought he had never seen
a woman so pale.</p>

<p>“Captain, let them in!” she cried. “I’ve got to
tell you. Hal&mdash;is injured. Open the door, quick!
Get Dr. Filhiol!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything else forgotten now, the captain turned,
precipitated himself into the hall and snatched open
the front door. Gusts of rain and wind tugged at him,
flapping his bath robe. For a moment, not understanding
anything, he stood peering out at what was all
a blur of perfectly incomprehensible confusion. His
fear-stricken eyes and brain failed to register any clear
perception. A second or two, he neither heard nor
saw. Then he became aware that some one&mdash;Jim
Gordon, yes&mdash;was saying:</p>

<p>“We done the best we could, cap’n. Got him here
as fast as we could. We’ll bring him right in.”</p>

<p>The captain saw something white out there on the
dark, wet porch. In the midst of this whiteness a form
was visible&mdash;and now the old man perceived a face;
Hal’s face&mdash;and what, for God’s sake, was all this
crimson stain?</p>

<p>He plunged forward, thrusting the men aside. A
lantern swung, and he saw clearly.</p>

<p>“God above! They’ve&mdash;they’ve murdered him!”</p>

<p>“No, cap’n, he ain’t dead yit,” said some one, “but
you’d better git him ’tended to, right snug off.”</p>

<p>Old Briggs was on his knees now gathering the lax
figure to his arms.</p>

<p>“Hal! Hal!”</p>

<p>“Shhh!” exclaimed Gordon. “No use makin’ a
touse, cap’n. He’s cut some, that’s a fact, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who killed my boy?” cried the old man, terrible to
look upon. “Who did this thing?”</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs,” said Laura tremulously, as she
pulled at his sleeve, “you mustn’t waste a minute!
Not a second! He’s got to be put right to bed.
We’ve got to get a doctor now!”</p>

<p>“Here, cap’n, we’ll carry him in, fer ye,” spoke up
Shorrocks. “Git up, cap’n, an’ we’ll lug him right in
the front room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody shall carry my boy into this house but just
his grandfather!” cried the captain in a loud, strange
voice.</p>

<p>The old-time strength of Alpheus Briggs surged
back. His arms, that felt no weakness now, gathered
up Hal as in the old days they had caught him when a
child. Into the house he bore him, with the others following;
into the cabin, and so to the berth. The boy’s
head, hanging limp, rested against the old man’s arm,
tensed with supreme effort. The crimson stain from
the grandson’s breast tinged the grandsire’s. Down in
the berth the captain laid him, and, raising his head,
entreated:</p>

<p>“Hal, boy! Speak to me&mdash;speak!”</p>

<p>Gordon laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no use, cap’n,” said he. “He’s too fur
gone.” With a muffled clumping of feet the others,
dripping, awed, silent, trickled into the room. Laura
had already run up-stairs, swift-footed, in quest of Dr.
Filhiol. “It ain’t no use. Though mebbe if we was
to git a little whisky into him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hal! Master Hal!” wailed a voice of agony.
Old Ezra, ghastly and disheveled, appeared in the doorway.
He would have run to the berth, but Shorrocks
held him back.</p>

<p>“You can’t do no good, Ez!” he growled. “He’s
gotta have air&mdash;don’t you go crowdin’ now!”</p>

<p>The shuffling of lame feet announced Dr. Filhiol.
Laura, still in her drenched long coat, helped him move
swiftly. Calkins shoved up a chair for him beside
the berth, and the old doctor dropped into it.</p>

<p>“A light here!” commanded he, with sudden return
of professional instinct and authority. Laura
threw off her coat, seized the lamp from its swinging-ring
over the desk, and held it close. Its shine revealed
the pallor of her face, the great beauty of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
eyes, the soul of her that seemed made visible in their
compassionate depths, where dwelt an infinite forgiveness.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stand back, captain,” ordered the
doctor succinctly. “You’re only smothering him that
way, holding him in your arms; and you must <i>not</i> kiss
him! Lay him down&mdash;so! Ezra, stop that noise!
Give me scissors or a knife, quick!”</p>

<p>Speaking, the doctor was already at work. With
the sharp blade that Calkins passed him he cut away the
blood-soaked bandage and threw it to the floor. His
old hands did not tremble now; the call of duty had
steeled his muscles with instinctive reactions. His
eyes, narrowed behind their spectacles, made careful
appraisal.</p>

<p>“Deep stab-wound,” said he. “How did he get
this? Any one know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“He got it in the cabin of the <i>Kittiwink</i>,” answered
Laura. “Everything was smashed up there. It
looked to me as if Hal had fought three or four men.”</p>

<p>“McLaughlin’s!” cried the captain. His fists
clenched passionately. “Oh, God! They’ve murdered
my boy! Is he going to die, Filhiol? Is he?”</p>

<p>“That’s impossible to say. We’ll need plenty of
hot water here, and soap and peroxide. Towels, lots
of them! Ezra, you hear me? Get your local doctor
at once. And have him bring his surgical kit as well
as his medical. Tell him it’s a deep stab, with great
loss of blood. Get a move on, somebody!”</p>

<p>Ezra, Gordon and Calkins departed. The front
door slammed, feet ran across the porch, then down
the steps and away.</p>

<p>“Everybody else go, too,” directed Filhiol. “We
can’t have outsiders messing round here. Get out, all
the rest of you&mdash;and mind now you don’t go making
any loose talk about who did it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Silently the fishermen obeyed. A minute, and no
one was left in the cabin save old Briggs, Filhiol and
Laura, gathered beside the wounded, immobile figure
in the berth.</p>

<p>“How long will it take to get your local doctor?”
demanded Filhiol, inspecting the wound that still oozed
bright, frothy blood, showing the lung to be involved in
the injury.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes, perhaps,” said Laura.</p>

<p>“H-m! There’s no time to lose here.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to die?” asked the old captain, his voice
now firm. He had grown calm again; only his lips
were very tight, and under the lamp-glow his forehead
gleamed with myriad tiny drops. “Is this boy of mine
going to die?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell? Why ask?”</p>

<p>“If he does, I won’t survive him! That’s the simple
truth.”</p>

<p>“H-m!” grunted Filhiol, once more. He cast an
oblique glance at the captain. And in that second he
realized that the thought, which had been germinating
in his brain, could lead him nowhere; the thought that
now his wish had really come to pass&mdash;that Hal was
really now his patient, as he had wished the boy might
be. He knew, now, that even though he could so far
forget his ethics as to fail in his whole duty toward Hal
Briggs, the captain held an unconscious whip-hand over
him. Just those few simple words, spoken from the
soul&mdash;”I won’t survive him”&mdash;had closed the doors
of possibility for a great crime.</p>

<p>Ezra came in with a steaming basin, with soap and
many towels.</p>

<p>“Put those on this chair here,” commanded Filhiol.
“And then either keep perfectly quiet, or get out and
stay out!”</p>

<p>Cowed, the old man tremblingly obliterated himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in the shadow behind the desk. The doctor began a
little superficial cleaning up of his patient. Hal had
still shown no signs of consciousness, nor had he
opened his eyes. Yet the fact was, he remained entirely
conscious. Everything that was said he heard
and understood. But the paralysis gripping him had
made of him a thing wherein no slightest power lay to
indicate his thought, or understanding. Alive, yet
dead, he lay there, much as the <i>amok</i> Malay of fifty
years before had lain upon the deck of the <i>Silver Fleece</i>.
And all his vital forces now had narrowed to just one
effort&mdash;to keep heart and lungs in laboring action.</p>

<p>Little by little the invading poison was attacking
even this last citadel of his life. Little by little, heart
and lungs were failing, as the <i>curaré</i> fingered its way
into the last, inner nerve-centers. But still life fought.
And as the doctor bent above Hal, washing away the
blood from lips and throat and chest, a half-instinctive
analysis of the situation forced itself upon him. This
wound, these symptoms&mdash;well, what other diagnosis
would apply?</p>

<p>“There’s something more at work here,” thought
he, “than just loss of blood. This man could stand a
deal of that and still not be in any such collapse.
There’s poison of some kind at work. And if this
wound isn’t the cut of a kris, I never saw one!”</p>

<p>He raised one eyelid, and peered at the pupil. Then
he closed the eye again.</p>

<p>“By the Almighty!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“What is it, doctor?” demanded the captain.
“Don’t keep anything from me!”</p>

<p>“I hate to tell you!”</p>

<p>The old man caught his breath, but never flinched.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” he commanded. Laura peered in silence,
very white. “I can stand it. Tell me all there
is to tell!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, captain, from what I find here&mdash;there can
be no doubt&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No doubt of what?”</p>

<p>“The blade that stabbed Hal was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That poisoned kris?”</p>

<p>Filhiol nodded silently.</p>

<p>“God above! The curse&mdash;retribution!”</p>

<p>“Oh, for heaven’s sake, captain, drop all that nonsense!”
flared out the doctor from taut nerves.
“This is no time for your infernal superstitions!
We’ve got all we can handle without cluttering things
up with a mess of rubbish. We’ve got a long, hard
fight on our hands.”</p>

<p>“I know. But you can save him, doctor! You
must!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all in human power. This wound here
I’m not in a position to deal with. Your local doctor
can attend to that. It isn’t the vital feature of this
case. The poison is!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a remedy for that, haven’t you? You
said you had!”</p>

<p>“Do you realize it’s been an hour, perhaps, since
this wound was made? If the <i>curaré</i> had been fresh
and new&mdash;” He finished with an expressive gesture.
“It’s old and dried, and some of it must have
been worn off the blade. Perhaps, not a great deal
got into the cut. There’s a chance, a fighting chance&mdash;perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Then the remedy! Quick, doctor! Get it, make
it!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to wait till the physician comes. I’ve
got no drugs with me.”</p>

<p>“Will he have the right ones?”</p>

<p>“They’re common enough. It all depends on the
formula, the exact mixture.”</p>

<p>“You remember them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe I can, if you don’t disturb my mind too
much.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be quiet, doctor. You just order me, and
I’ll do anything you say,” the old man promised abjectly.
His eyes were cavernous with suffering.
“Lord God! why don’t Dr. Marsh come?”</p>

<p>“Hal here is suffering from a general paralysis,”
said Filhiol. “This <i>curaré</i> is peculiar stuff.” He
laid his ear to Hal’s chest, listened a moment, then
raised his head. “There’s some heart-action yet,”
said he. “Our problem is to keep it going, and the
respiration, till the effects pass. It’s quite possible
Hal isn’t unconscious. He may know what’s going
on. With this poison the victim feels and knows
and understands, and yet can’t move hand or foot.
In fact, he’s reduced to complete helplessness.”</p>

<p>“And yet you call me superstitious when I talk
retribution!” the captain whispered tensely. “I lived
by force in the old days. He, poor boy, put all his
faith and trust in it; he made it his God, and worshipped
it. And now&mdash;he’s struck down, helpless&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> strange,” Filhiol had to admit. “I don’t
believe in anything like that. But certainly this is
very, very strange. Yes, your grandson is more helpless
now than any child. Even if he lives, he’ll be
helpless for a long time, and very weak for months
and months. This kind of <i>curaré</i> used by the upper
Malay people is the most diabolical stuff ever concocted.
Its effects are swift and far-reaching; they
last a long, long time, in case they don’t kill at once.
Hal can never be the same man he used to be, captain.
You’ve got to make up your mind to that, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord for it!” the old man fervently
ejaculated. “Thank the good Lord above!”</p>

<p>“If he lives, he may sometime get back a fair
amount of strength. He may be as well as an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
man, but the days of his unbridled power and
his terrific force are all over. His fighting heart
and arrogant soul are gone, never to return.”</p>

<p>“God is being very good to me!” cried Briggs,
tears starting down his wrinkled cheeks.</p>

<p>“Amen to that!” said Laura. “I don’t care what
he’ll be, doctor. Only give him back to me!”</p>

<p>“He’ll be an invalid a very long time, girl.”</p>

<p>“And all that time I can nurse him and love him
back to health!”</p>

<p>Footsteps suddenly clattered on the porch. The
front door flung open.</p>

<p>“Laura! Are you all right? Are you safe?”
cried a new voice.</p>

<p>“There’s my father!” exclaimed the girl. “And
there’s Dr. Marsh, with him!”</p>

<p>Into the cabin penetrated two men. Nathaniel Maynard&mdash;thin,
gray, wiry&mdash;stood staring. The physician,
brisk and competent, set his bag on a chair
and peeled off his coat, dripping rain.</p>

<p>“Laura! Tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not now, father! Shhh! I’m all right, every
way. But Hal here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We won’t have any unnecessary conversation, Mr.
Maynard,” directed Dr. Marsh. He approached the
berth. “What is this, now? Stab-wound? Ah, yes.
Well, I’ll wash right up and get to work.”</p>

<p>“Do, please,” answered Filhiol. “You can handle
it alone, all right. I’ve got a job of my own. There’s
poisoning present, too. <i>Curaré.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Curaré!</i>” exclaimed Marsh, amazed. “That’s
most unusual! Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t serve on ships in the Orient, for nothing,”
answered Filhiol with asperity. “My diagnosis is
absolute. There was dried <i>curaré</i> on the blade that
stabbed this man. It’s a very complex poison&mdash;either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>35</sub>N, or C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>35</sub>N. Only one man, Sir Robert
Schomburg, ever found out how the natives make
it, and only one man&mdash;myself&mdash;ever learned the
secret of the antidote.”</p>

<p>“So, so?” commented Marsh, rolling up his shirt-sleeve.
He set out antiseptics, dressings, pads, drainage,
and proceeded to scrub up. “We can’t do this
work here in the berth. Clear the desk, Ezra,” he
directed. “It’s long enough for an operating-table.
Make up a bed there&mdash;a few blankets and a clean
sheet. Then we can lift him over. We’ll strip his
chest as he lies&mdash;cut the clothes off. Lively, every
one! <i>Curaré</i>, eh? I never came in contact with it,
Dr. Filhiol. I’m not above asking its physiological
effects.”</p>

<p>“It’s unique,” answered Filhiol. He got up from
beside the wounded man and approached the chair on
which stood the doctor’s bag. “It produces a type
of pure motor-paralysis, acting on the end plates of
the muscles and the peripheral end-organs of the
motor-nerves. First it attacks the voluntary muscles,
and then those of respiration. It doesn’t cause unconsciousness,
however. The patient here may know
all that’s going on, but he can’t make a sign. Don’t
trust to this apparent unconsciousness in exploring
the wound. Give plenty of anesthetic, just as if he
seemed fully conscious.”</p>

<p>“Glad you told me that,” said Marsh, nodding.
“How about stimulants, or even a little nitroglycerine
for the heart?”</p>

<p>“Useless. There’s just one remedy.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve got it?”</p>

<p>“I can compound it, I think. It’s a secret, given
me fifty years ago by a Parsee in Bombay. He’d
have lost his life for having given it, if it had been
known. Let me have some of your drugs, will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“Help yourself,” answered Marsh, drying his hands.</p>

<p>While Laura and the captain watched in silence,
Filhiol opened the bag, and after some deliberation
chose three vials.</p>

<p>“All right,” said he. “Now you to your work,
and I to mine!”</p>

<p>“Got everything you need?”</p>

<p>“I’ll want a hypodermic when I come back&mdash;if I
succeed in compounding the formula.”</p>

<p>“How long will you be?”</p>

<p>“If I’m <i>very</i> long&mdash;” His look finished the phrase.
Laura came close to Filhiol.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” she whispered, her face tense with terrible
earnestness. “You <i>must</i> remember the formula.
You can’t fail! There’s more than Hal’s life at stake,
now. The captain&mdash;you’ve got to save him!”</p>

<p>“And you, too! Your happiness&mdash;that is to say,
your life!” the old man answered, laying a hand on
hers. “I understand it all, dear. All, perfectly. I
needn’t tell you more than that!”</p>

<p>He turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“Captain Briggs, sir,” said he, “I was with you in
the old days, and I’m with you now&mdash;all the way
through. Courage, and don’t give up the ship!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<p class="pch">NEW DAWN</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, anxious fingers tapped at
Filhiol’s door.</p>

<p>“Come!” bade the doctor. Laura entered.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” she begged. “I&mdash;I couldn’t stay
away. Dr. Marsh has got the wound closed. He
says that, in itself, isn’t fatal. But&mdash;”</p>

<p>She could not finish. From the hallway, through
the open door, penetrated the smell of ether.</p>

<p>“The captain’s been just splendid!” said she.
“And Ezra’s got his nerve back. I’ve helped as much
as I could. Hal’s in the berth again.”</p>

<p>“What’s his condition?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Marsh says the heart action is very weak and
slow.”</p>

<p>“Respiration?” And Filhiol peered over his glasses
at her as he sat there before his washstand, on which
he had spread a newspaper, now covered with various
little piles of powder.</p>

<p>“Hardly ten to the minute. For God’s sake, doctor,
do something! Haven’t you got the formula
yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Laura. It’s a very delicate compound,
and I have no means here for making proper analyses,
or even for weighing out minute quantities. I don’t
suppose a man ever tried to work under such fearful
handicaps.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she answered. “But&mdash;oh, there must
be <i>some</i> way you can get it!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met and silence came. On the porch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
roof, below the doctor’s window, the rain was ruffling
all its drums. The window, rattled in its sash, seemed
in the grip of some jinnee that sought to force entrance.
Filhiol glanced down at his little powders
and said:</p>

<p>“Here’s what I’m up against, Laura. I’m positively
sure one of these two nearest me is correct.
But I can’t tell which.”</p>

<p>“Why not test them?”</p>

<p>“One or the other is fearfully poisonous. My old
brain doesn’t work as well as it used to, and after
fifty years&mdash;But, yes, one of these two here,” and
he pointed at the little conical heaps nearest him with
the point of the knife wherewith he had been mixing
them, “one of these two must be the correct formula.
The other&mdash;well, it’s deadly. I don’t know which is
which.”</p>

<p>“If you knew definitely which one was poisonous,”
asked she, “would that make you certain of the
other?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, not at all understanding.
“But without the means of making qualitative analyses,
or the time for them, how can I find out?”</p>

<p>She had come close, and now stood at his left side.
Before he could advance a hand to stop her, she had
caught up, between thumb and finger, a little of the
powder nearest her and had put it into her mouth.</p>

<p>“Holy Lord, girl!” shouted the old man, springing
up. His chair clashed to the floor. “How do you
know which&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll know in a few moments, won’t I?” she asked.
“And then you’ll be able to give the right one to Hal?”</p>

<p>The old doctor could only stare at her. Then he
groaned, and began to cry. The tears that had not
flowed in years were flowing now. For the first time
in all that long and lonesome life, without the love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
woman to soften it, he had realized what manner of
thing a woman’s love can be.</p>

<p>She remained there, smiling a little, untroubled,
calm. The doctor blinked away his tears, ashamed.</p>

<p>“Laura,” said he, “I didn’t think there was anything
like that in the world. I didn’t think there was
any woman anywhere like you. It’s too wonderful
for any words. So I won’t talk about it. But tell
me, now, what sensations do you get?” His face
grew anxious with a very great fear. He came close
to her, took her hand, closely watched her. “Do
you feel anything yet?”</p>

<p>“There’s a kind of stinging sensation on my tongue,”
she answered, with complete quietude, as though the
scales of life and death for her had not an even balance.
“And&mdash;well, my mouth feels a little numb and cold.
Is that the poison?”</p>

<p>“Do you experience any dizziness?” His voice was
hardly audible. By the lamp-light his pale face and
widened eyes looked very strange. “Does your heart
begin to accelerate? Here, let me see!”</p>

<p>He took her wrist, carefully observing the pulse.</p>

<p>“No, doctor,” she answered, “I don’t feel anything
except just what I’ve already told you.”</p>

<p>“Thank the good God for that!” he exclaimed,
letting her hand fall. “You’re all right. You got
the harmless powder. Laura, you’re&mdash;you’re too
wonderful for me even to try to express it. You’re&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’re wasting time here!” she exclaimed.
“Every second’s precious. You know which powder
to use, now. Come along!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right. I’ll come at once.” He turned,
took up the knife, and with its blade scraped on to a
bit of paper the powder that the girl had tested. This
he wrapped up carefully and tucked into his waistcoat-pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dow-nstairs, Laura!” said he. “If we can pull
him through, it’s you that have saved him&mdash;it’s <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p class="p2">The thud of the old doctor’s feet seemed to echo in
the captain’s heart like thunders of doom. He got up
from beside the berth and faced the door, like a man
who waits the summons to walk forth at dawn and
face the firing-squad. Dr. Marsh, still seated by the
berth, frowned and shook his head. Evidently he had
no faith in this old man, relic of a school past and
gone, who claimed to know strange secrets of the
Orient.</p>

<p>“This boy is dying,” thought Marsh. “I don’t
believe in all this talk about <i>curaré</i>. He’s dying of
hemorrhage and shock. His pulse and respiration are
practically <i>nil</i>&mdash;his skin is dusky with suffocation
already. Even if the old chap has a remedy, he’s
too late. Hal’s gone&mdash;and it will kill the captain,
too. What a curse seems to have hung to this family!
Wiped out, all wiped out!”</p>

<p>In the doorway appeared Laura and old Filhiol.
The girl’s face was burning with excitement. The
doctor’s eyes shone strangely.</p>

<p>“Still alive, is he?” demanded Filhiol.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Marsh. “But you’ve got no time
for more than one experiment.”</p>

<p>“Got it, Filhiol?” choked the captain. His hands
twitched with appeal. “Tell me you’ve&mdash;got it!”</p>

<p>“Water! The hypodermic needle!” directed Filhiol,
his voice a whiplash.</p>

<p>He mixed the powder in a quarter-glass of water,
and drew the solution up into the glass barrel of the
syringe. Ezra, unable to bear any further strain, sank
down in a chair, buried his face in both hands and
remained there, motionless. Dr. Marsh, frankly skeptical,
watched in silence. The girl, her arm about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the captain, was whispering something to him.
Through the room sounded a hollow roaring, blent of
surf and tempest and wind-buffetings of the great
chimney.</p>

<p>Filhiol handed the hypodermic to Marsh.</p>

<p>“Administer this,” he commanded. “Your hands
have been sterilized, and mine haven’t. We mustn’t
even waste the time for me to scrub up, and I’m taking
no chances at all with any non-surgical conditions.”</p>

<p>Marsh nodded. The old man was undoubtedly a
little cracked, but it could do no harm to humor him.
Marsh quickly prepared an area of Hal’s arm, rubbing
it with alcohol. He tossed away the pledget of cotton,
pinched up the bloodless skin, and jabbed the needle
home.</p>

<p>“All of it?” asked he, as he pushed down the ring.</p>

<p>“All!” answered Filhiol. “It’s a thundering dosage,
but this is no time for half measures!”</p>

<p>The ring came wholly down. Marsh withdrew the
needle, took more cotton and again rubbed the puncture.
Then he felt Hal’s pulse, and very grimly shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Laura,” said he, “I think you’d better go. Your
father, when he left, told me to tell you he wanted
you to go home.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid to see Hal die, if he’s got to die,
any more than I’m afraid to have him live. He’s
mine, either way.” Her eyes were wonderful. “I’m
going to stay!”</p>

<p>“Well, as you wish.” Dr. Marsh turned back to
his observation of the patient.</p>

<p>Filhiol stood beside him. Wan and haggard he
was, with deep lines of exhaustion in his face. The
old captain, seated now at the head of the berth, was
leaning close, listening to each slow gasp. Now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
again he passed a hand over his forehead, but always
the sweat dampened it once more.</p>

<p>“Any change?” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Marsh answered.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t take effect so soon, anyhow,” cut in
Filhiol. “It’ll be ten minutes before it’s noticeable.”</p>

<p>Marsh curled a lip of scorn. What did this superannuated
relic know? What, save folly, could be expected
of him?</p>

<p>The seconds dragged to minutes, and still Marsh kept
his hold on the boy’s wrist. A gust of wind puffed
ashes out upon the hearth. Somewhere at the back of
the house a loose blind slammed. The tumult of the
surf shuddered the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, God! Can’t you tell yet?” whispered the
captain. “Can’t you tell?”</p>

<p>“<i>Shhh!</i>” cautioned Filhiol. “Remember, you’re
captain of this clipper. You’ve got to hold your
nerve!”</p>

<p>The clock on the mantel gave a little preliminary
click, then began striking. One by one it tolled out
twelve musical notes, startlingly loud in that tense
silence.</p>

<p>Marsh shifted his feet, pursed his lips and leaned a
little forward. He drew out his watch.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he grunted.</p>

<p>“Better?” gulped Alpheus Briggs. “Better&mdash;or
worse?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be damned!” exclaimed Marsh.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> it?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Filhiol, you’ve done it!”</p>

<p>“Is he&mdash;dead?” breathed Laura.</p>

<p>“Two more beats per minute already!” Marsh answered.
“And greater amplitude. Captain Briggs,
if nothing happens now, your boy will live!”</p>

<p>The old man tried to speak, but the words died on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
his white lips. His eyes closed, his head dropped forward
as he sat there, and his arms fell limp. In his
excess of joy, Captain Alpheus Briggs had fainted.</p>

<p class="p2">By early dawn the tempest, blowing itself clean
away with all its wrack of cloud and rain, left a pure-washed
sky of rose and blue over-arching the wild-tossing
sea. The sun burned its way in gold and crimson
up into a morning sprayed with spindrift from the
surf-charges against the granite coast. All along the
north shore that wave army charged; and the bell-buoy,
wildly clanging, seemed to revel in furious exultation
over the departed storm.</p>

<p>The early rays flashed out billions of jewels from
drops of water trembling on the captain’s lawn.
Through the eastward-looking portholes of the cabin,
long spears of sunlight penetrated, paling the flames
on the hearth. Those flames had been fed with wood
surpassing strange&mdash;with all the captain’s barbarous
collection of bows and arrows, blowpipes, spears and
clubs, even to the brutal “Penang lawyer” itself.</p>

<p>Before the fire, in a big chair, Ezra slept in absolute
exhaustion. Dr. Marsh was gone. By the berth Filhiol
was still on guard with Laura and the captain.
All three were spent with the terrible vigil, but happiness
brooded over them, and none thought of rest or
sleep.</p>

<p>In the berth, now with open eyes, lay Hal, his face
white as the pillow. With the conquering of the
paralysis, some slight power of motion had returned
to him; but the extreme exhaustion of that heavy loss
of blood still gripped him. His eyes, though, moved
from face to face of the three watchers, and his blue
lips were smiling.</p>

<p>A different look lay in those eyes than any that had
ever been there, even in the boy’s moments of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
good humor. No longer was there visible that latent
expression of arrogance, of power, cruelty and pride
that at any moment had been wont to leap like a
trapped beast tearing its cage asunder. Hal’s look was
now not merely weakness; it took hold on gentleness
and on humanity; it was the look of one who, having
always gloried in the right of might, had found it
swiftly turn to the bursting bubble of illusion.</p>

<p>This Hal now lying bandaged and inert in the old
captain’s berth was no longer the Hal of yesterday.
That personality had died; another had replaced it.
Something had departed from the boy’s face, never to
return again. One would almost have said the eyes
were those of madness that had become suddenly sane&mdash;eyes
from which a curse had all at once been lifted,
leaving them rational and calm.</p>

<p>Hal’s eyes drifted from the old doctor’s face to the
captain’s, rested a moment on Laura, and then wandered
to the fireplace. Surprise came, at sight of the bare
bricks. The captain understood.</p>

<p>“They’re gone, Hal,” said he. “Burned up&mdash;they
were all part and parcel of the old life; and now
that <i>that’s</i> gone they can’t have any place here. I
know you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>Hal made an effort. His lips formed the words
soundlessly: “I understand.”</p>

<p>“He’ll do now,” said Filhiol. “I’m pretty far gone.
I’ve got to get a little rest or you’ll have two sick men
on your hands. If you need anything, call me, though.
And don’t let him talk! That punctured lung of his
has got to rest!”</p>

<p>He got up heavily, patted Hal’s hand that lay outside
the spread, and hobbled toward the door.</p>

<p>The captain followed him, laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said he in a low tone, “if you knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
you’ve done for me&mdash;if you could only understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None of that, sir!” interrupted the old man sternly.
“A professional duty, sir, nothing more!”</p>

<p>“A million times more than that! You’ve opened
up a new heaven and a new earth. You’ve given Hal
back to me! I can see the change. It’s real! The
old book’s closed. The new one’s opened. You’ve
saved a thing infinitely more than life to me. You’ve
saved my boy!”</p>

<p>Filhiol nodded.</p>

<p>“And you, too,” he murmured. “Yes, facts are
facts. Still, it was all in the line of duty. We’re
neither of us too old to stand up to duty, captain. I
hope we’ll never be. Hal’s cured. There can’t be any
manner of doubt about <i>that</i>. The curse of unbridled
strength is lifted from him. He’s another man now.
The powers of darkness have defeated themselves.
And the new dawn is breaking.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, looking intently into the old
captain’s face, then turned again toward the door.</p>

<p>“I’m very tired now,” said he. “There’s nothing
more I can do. Let me go, captain.”</p>

<p>Alpheus Briggs clasped his hand in silence. For a
long minute the hands of the two old men gripped
each other with eloquent force. Then Filhiol hobbled
through the door and disappeared.</p>

<p>The captain turned back to Laura. There were
tears in his eyes as he said:</p>

<p>“If there were more like Filhiol, what a different
world this would be!”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a different world to-day, anyhow, from what
it was yesterday,” smiled Laura. She bent over Hal
and smoothed back the heavy black hair from his white
forehead. “A different world for all of us, Hal!”</p>

<p>His hand moved slightly, but could not go to hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
She took it, clasped it against her full, warm breast,
and raised it to her mouth and kissed it. She felt a
slight, almost imperceptible pressure of his fingers.
Her smile grew deep with meaning, for in that instant
visions of the future were revealed.</p>

<p>The sunlight, strengthening, moved slowly across
the wall whence now the kris had been torn down. A
ray touched the old captain’s white hair, englorifying
it. He laid his hand on Laura’s hand and Hal’s; and
in his eyes were tears, but now glad tears that washed
away all bitter memories.</p>

<p>From without, through a half-opened window that
let sweet June drift in, echoed sounds of life. Voices
of village children sounded along the hedge. Cartwheels
rattled. The anvil, early at work, sent up its
musical <i>clank-clank-clank</i> to Snug Haven.</p>

<p>From an elm near the broad porch, the sudden
melody of a robin, greeting the new day after the
night of storm, echoed in hearts now infinitely glad.</p>
